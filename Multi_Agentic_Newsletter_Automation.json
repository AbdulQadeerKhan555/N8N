          "output": "## Custom AI Workforce\n\nFor small-business leaders navigating today's competitive landscape, the concept of a custom AI workforce is emerging as a powerful solution to perennial challenges like staff shortages and rising customer expectations [1]. This innovative approach brings enterprise-grade automation within reach of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), allowing them to deploy specialized AI agents tailored to their unique operational needs [1, 2].\n\nUnlike generic AI tools, a custom AI employee is an intelligent agent built and trained on a business's specific workflows, rules, internal documents, and customer data [1, 3]. This deep integration enables the AI to perform real work that aligns precisely with a company's established processes, rather than just offering general assistance [3]. Businesses define the role, train the AI using their existing knowledge and procedures, and then deploy it where needed, often with no-code setup required [1, 3].\n\nThe benefits for SMBs are significant, including standardizing key workflows, enhancing customer touchpoints, and unlocking new levels of productivity without needing to expand headcount [1, 2]. These custom AI agents can connect to existing business systems via APIs, allowing them to take practical actions beyond simple chat. This means they can check inventory, create CRM records, schedule appointments, or manage billing follow-ups, operating consistently across various channels such as website chat, internal team communication, and automated workflows [3].\n\nReal-world applications highlight the transformative potential. For instance, at Blue River Digital, a custom AI employee named \"Banks\" revolutionized their sales process by generating six proposals in minutes instead of hours, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This allowed the team to scale operations more efficiently without adding staff [1, 3]. Similarly, The Xcite Group leveraged their custom AI, \"Klaygent,\" to train on years of internal advertising data, enabling every team member to provide instant, expert-level recommendations, improving sales effectiveness and customer experience [1, 3]. Beyond these, custom AI can handle a wide array of high-volume tasks like quoting, project updates, internal knowledge support, and customer communications [3].\n\nThis tailored integration of AI stands in contrast to the historical trend where the biggest gains from generative AI often favored larger organizations with deep integration capabilities [1]. By focusing on practical, workflow-ready AI, SMBs can now equip their human teams to be more productive. As the AI landscape evolves, the focus shifts from replacing workers to augmenting them, empowering a \"centaur\" workforce (human + AI) that drives greater value [5]. The future envisions an expansion of these AI workforces, with more pre-configured options for common roles like reputation management and sales operations, alongside the ongoing flexibility for businesses to build fully custom AI solutions [1, 2]. This marks the dawn of a truly AI-powered local economy, addressing chronic staff shortages with intelligent, scalable solutions [1].\n\n---\nSources:\n[1] Vendasta Unveils Custom AI Employees to Redefine the Future of... — vendasta.com\n[2] Vendasta Unveils Custom AI Employees to Redefine the Future of... — finance.yahoo.com\n[3] Custom AI Employees - Vendasta — vendasta.com\n[4] Custom AI Solutions - Turbine Workforce — turbineworkforce.com\n[5] AI Revolution 2025: Building the Future Workforce Today — baytechconsulting.com"

          "output": "## AI Tool Accuracy & Use\n\nAs AI tools become increasingly integrated into daily operations, small-business leaders must approach their implementation with a clear understanding of their inherent limitations, particularly regarding accuracy. Even the most advanced AI models are not infallible; for instance, the top-performing Gemini 3 Pro model achieves only 68.8% overall factual accuracy, meaning it gets facts wrong roughly one-third of the time [1]. This underscores the critical need for human oversight and verification of AI-generated content.\n\nThe reliability challenges extend to tools designed to detect AI-generated content. A multitude of AI detectors exist, claiming to identify text and images produced by large language models like GPT [2]. However, multiple studies indicate these detectors are \"neither accurate nor reliable,\" frequently generating high rates of both false positives and false negatives [5, 2]. False positives incorrectly flag human-written content as AI-generated, which can lead to significant issues, particularly given that these tools are prone to flagging non-native English speakers or neurodivergent writers at higher rates due to their writing styles [5]. Conversely, false negatives occur when AI-generated text goes undetected. Users can often circumvent these detectors through simple evasive techniques, such as paraphrasing, adding emotional elements, or using specialized \"humanizer\" AI tools [5]. This creates an \"eternal arms race\" where generators and detectors constantly evolve, with no definitive solution in sight [5].\n\nGiven these detection challenges and the inherent inaccuracies of generative AI, the imperative for human vetting is paramount. Small-business leaders and their teams must develop strong critical thinking skills to evaluate AI-generated output. Before using any AI output, it is essential to check its accuracy, verify facts, and assess for potential biases, as AI models are trained on internet content that can contain misinformation or reflect existing biases [3]. The responsibility ultimately falls on the user to ensure the information is correct and appropriate for its intended purpose [3].\n\nTo truly gauge the value of AI in decision-making, it's crucial to move beyond simple accuracy assessments to a more comprehensive evaluation framework. Five key metrics can help measure the real-world impact of AI-generated answers on organizational decisions: accuracy, relevance, coherence, helpfulness, and user trust [4]. Accuracy confirms factual correctness against authoritative sources; relevance ensures the response directly addresses user intent within the specific business context; coherence assesses the logical structure and clarity of the information; helpfulness measures whether the AI output actually enables users to accomplish their goals and make better decisions; and user trust reflects the overall confidence employees have in the AI system based on consistent positive experiences [4]. By focusing on these broader metrics, small businesses can effectively evaluate if AI tools are genuinely enhancing productivity and driving better outcomes, rather than just delivering information.\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] Google's New Benchmark Reveals Wide Gaps in AI Factual Accuracy — hackshackers.com\n[2] Artificial Intelligence Tools for Detection, Research and Writing — guides.library.ttu.edu\n[3] Dos and Don'ts of AI - Artificial Intelligence for Students — ulm.libguides.com\n[4] 5 metrics to measure AI-generated answers' decision-making impact — glean.com\n[5] False Positives and False Negatives - Generative AI Detection Tools — lawlibguides.sandiego.edu"

          "output": "## Data Readiness for AI\n\nThe allure of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for boosting efficiency, gaining insights, and transforming operations is undeniable for small-business leaders. However, effectively harnessing AI's power hinges on a foundational, often overlooked, element: data readiness [1, 5]. Many organizations are enthusiastic, with 94% increasing spending on AI data readiness, yet only 21% have successfully integrated AI into their operations [1]. Without a robust data strategy, AI initiatives risk failure, with Gartner estimating that 60% of AI projects built on unready data will be abandoned by 2026 [3].\n\nThe core principle is simple: \"garbage in, garbage out\" [1]. If the data used to train AI models is biased, incomplete, outdated, or inconsistent, the AI's outputs will reflect these flaws. This is especially true for unstructured data—emails, documents, images, and videos—which constitutes 80-90% of enterprise data and is crucial for advanced AI innovation [1]. Dispersed across silos, difficult to access, and often lacking proper management, this vast dataset holds immense potential if properly prepared [1].\n\nAchieving AI-ready data requires a strategic approach focusing on several key pillars:\n\n1.  **Quality and Trustworthiness:** Data must be complete, correct, consistent, and free of bias to generate reliable AI outputs [1, 3, 5]. Quality checkpoints need to be embedded by design, not as afterthoughts, to prevent AI from amplifying flaws and leading to \"hallucinations\" or incorrect decisions [3]. For instance, in finance, trusted data is critical because every AI-driven decision must be reproducible and explainable [4].\n\n2.  **Unification and Accessibility:** AI applications demand access to all critical data through a single, unified point [3]. Data fragmented across various systems (databases, cloud storage, spreadsheets) makes it challenging for AI models to connect disparate pieces of information, hindering comprehensive insights [3]. This also includes ensuring data is stored in the right place for the right workload, whether on-premise, in the cloud, or at the edge [1].\n\n3.  **Governance and Discoverability:** Strong data governance is paramount for managing data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring visibility, security, and compliance [1, 4, 5]. This means clear ownership, consistent metadata, documented data lineage, and a framework for risk and access controls [3, 4, 5]. Data should be discoverable without needing direct access to tables, requiring robust cataloging and standardized definitions to speed up AI development [3].\n\n4.  **Real-time Access and Contextualization:** Modern AI applications, such as personalized recommendations or fraud detection, require real-time data to make accurate decisions [3]. Stale data significantly limits effectiveness [3]. Moreover, data needs rich context to be meaningful to AI, including relationships, intent, and relevance [3]. Without proper contextualization, AI struggles to link information, leading to vague or inaccurate responses [3].\n\n5.  **Scalability and Cost Awareness:** AI workloads can be resource-intensive, incurring significant recurring costs for computation and data processing [3]. An AI-ready data infrastructure must consider the economic sustainability of scaling AI solutions, optimizing for efficiency without compromising performance [3].\n\nInterestingly, AI isn't just a consumer of ready data; it can actively enhance data management in a mutually beneficial cycle [2]. AI capabilities can automate data discovery, enrich metadata, detect anomalies in real-time, and monitor for policy violations, improving overall data quality and governance [2]. This symbiotic relationship suggests that data readiness is not a one-off hurdle, but a continuous process that AI itself can accelerate [2].\n\nUltimately, data readiness is an ongoing journey and an architectural shift, not a single project [1, 3]. Organizations that commit to building and maintaining strong data foundations will be better positioned to unlock AI's full value, foster long-term relationships with customers through enhanced services, and lead the next wave of innovation [1].\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n[1] How to sell: Data readiness for AI — Computerweekly (computerweekly.com)\n[2] Data Management & AI: The Two-Way Street of Data Readiness — Forvis Mazars (forvismazars.us)\n[3] 7 Data Readiness Checks You're Probably Skipping — But Your AI... — Talentica (talentica.com)\n[4] Data Readiness for AI Explained — LinkedIn (linkedin.com)\n[5] The big leap: Getting data AI-ready — EY - US (ey.com)"

These AI agents are built on Vendasta’s unified platform and trained on the unique workflows, rules, and customer data of each business. Starting today, SMBs—or the partners who help run their business, such as agencies, franchisors, resellers, and MSPs—can create and deploy Custom AI Employees.\n\nAt a time when small businesses face shrinking teams and rising customer expectations, Vendasta is making an AI workforce not only possible, but practical. According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could boost global GDP by roughly seven percent over the next decade. Yet OpenAI’s State of Enterprise AI report shows that the biggest gains come from deep integration and reusable workflows—conditions that have historically favored larger organizations. Vendasta is changing that by delivering workflow-ready AI designed specifically for SMBs.\n\n“The arrival of practical AI for small businesses is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and Vendasta is uniquely positioned to win it,” said Brendan King, CEO of Vendasta. “Our strength lies in providing a true AI Workforce Platform built on three unfair advantages: proprietary SMB data that lets our AI employees work ‘out of the box’, a unified platform where AI can instantly execute tasks across all front-office workflows, and a vast partner channel that can deliver this essential automation to every local business at scale. Our AI employees arrive pre-trained to capture leads, provide support, and market to existing customers, ensuring that no lead or customer is left behind.”\n\n## How Custom AI Employees Fit into Real Business Workflows\n\nDesigned for growing small & medium businesses of all kinds, Custom AI Employees can be brought into operations without custom development or complex AI configuration. Businesses define the role, train the AI Employee using the knowledge and processes they already use today, and put it to work where needed.\n\nVendasta’s platform gives SMBs a significant advantage by placing Custom AI Employees directly into the areas where work actually happens. A single AI employee can support website visitors, guide internal teams, and drive automated actions, all while referencing the same shared knowledge, data, and customer information. As they scale, additional AI Employees can be created in minutes, allowing businesses to expand their operations without rebuilding workflows or rewriting prompts.\n\n“SMBs are rich with vision, hustle, and heart,” King added. “But they’ve been crippled by a chronic staff shortage. Our Custom AI Employees fix that forever, serving as the workforce they need, delivered right inside the trusted platform they already use to manage everything. This is the dawn of the AI-powered local economy.”\n\n## Early Partners See Real-World Impact With Custom AI Employees\n\nEarly results from partners show how transformational Custom AI Employees can be for local businesses.\n\nAt Blue River Digital, a Custom AI Employee named *Banks* has become a core part of the team’s sales process. As VP of Growth and Development, Nick Prentice explained, “Our Custom AI Employee, Banks, has changed how we sell. What used to take hours now takes minutes. I can finish six proposals at the end of my day and know they’re accurate and consistent every time.”\n\nBy turning hours of manual proposal work into minutes, Banks helps the team move faster, stay consistent, and scale without adding headcount.\n\nAt The Xcite Group, their Custom AI Employee *Klaygent* was trained on years of internal advertising data, pricing models, and campaign strategies. According to co-founder Michael Klabon: “Our Custom AI Employee, Klaygent, turned years of internal knowledge into something the whole team can use. Klaygent helps us respond quickly with smarter recommendations, and that has made a noticeable difference in our sales process.”\n\nKlaygent gives every team member access to expert-level insight instantly, helping the company respond faster, close deals more effectively, and deliver a more consistent customer experience.\n\nThese stories highlight how Custom AI Employees help small businesses standardize key workflows, improve customer touchpoints, and unlock new levels of productivity without expanding their workforce.\n\n## What’s Next for Vendasta\n\nIn the coming months, Vendasta plans to expand the AI workforce with additional pre-configured AI Employees for common roles—such as managing business reputation, supporting sales operations, and delivering deeper analytical insights—while continuing to give businesses the flexibility to build fully custom AI Employees for their unique needs. These efforts will be supported by expanded integrations with third-party apps and deeper orchestration capabilities, enabling AI Employees to connect across systems and automate entire workflows end-to-end.  \n   \n Businesses and partners can start creating their first Custom AI Employee today at [**https://www.vendasta.com/ai-workforce/**](https://www.vendasta.com/ai-workforce/)**.** For media interviews, product demonstrations, or additional information, contact **media@vendasta.com**.\n\n## About Vendasta\n\nVendasta provides AI employees that help businesses attract, engage, and retain customers.

These AI agents are built on Vendasta’s unified platform and trained on the unique workflows, rules, and customer data of each business. Starting today, SMBs—or the partners who help run their business, such as agencies, franchisors, resellers, and MSPs—can create and deploy Custom AI Employees.\n\nAt a time when small businesses face shrinking teams and rising customer expectations, Vendasta is making an AI workforce not only possible, but practical. According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could boost global GDP by roughly seven percent over the next decade. Yet OpenAI’s State of Enterprise AI report shows that the biggest gains come from deep integration and reusable workflows—conditions that have historically favored larger organizations. Vendasta is changing that by delivering workflow-ready AI designed specifically for SMBs.\n\nAccording to research from Goldman Sachs, advances in generative AI could raise global GDP by roughly seven percent over the next decade, signaling a multi-trillion-dollar shift in how work gets done. While enterprises are already realizing productivity gains by embedding AI directly into everyday workflows, OpenAI’s State of Enterprise AI 2025 report shows that this level of impact has largely remained out of reach for smaller teams. Vendasta is closing that gap by delivering practical, workflow-ready AI designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\n\"The arrival of practical AI for small businesses is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and Vendasta is uniquely positioned to win it,\" said Brendan King, CEO of Vendasta. \"Our strength lies in providing a true AI Workforce Platform built on three unfair advantages: proprietary SMB data that lets our AI employees work 'out of the box', a unified platform where AI can instantly execute tasks across all front-office workflows, and a vast partner channel that can deliver this essential automation to every local business at scale. Our AI employees arrive pre-trained to capture leads, provide support, and market to existing customers, ensuring that no lead or customer is left behind.\"\n\nHow Custom AI Employees Fit into Real Business Workflows\n\nDesigned for growing local businesses of all kinds, Custom AI Employees can be brought into operations without custom development or complex AI configuration. Businesses define the role, train the AI Employee using the knowledge and processes they already use today, and put it to work where needed.\n\nVendasta’s platform gives SMBs a significant advantage by placing Custom AI Employees directly into the areas where work actually happens. A single AI employee can support website visitors, guide internal teams, and drive automated actions, all while referencing the same shared knowledge, data, and customer information. As they scale, additional AI Employees can be created in minutes, allowing businesses to expand their operations without rebuilding workflows or rewriting prompts.\n\n\"SMBs are rich with vision, hustle, and heart,\" King added. \"But they’ve been crippled by a chronic staff shortage. Our Custom AI Employees fix that forever, serving as the workforce they need, delivered right inside the trusted platform they already use to manage everything. This is the dawn of the AI-powered local economy.\"\n\nEarly Partners See Real-World Impact With Custom AI Employees\n\nEarly results from partners show how transformational Custom AI Employees can be for local businesses.\n\nAt Blue River Digital, a Custom AI Employee named Banks has become a core part of the team’s sales process. As VP of Growth and Development, Nick Prentice explained:\n\n“Our Custom AI Employee, Banks, has changed how we sell. What used to take hours now takes minutes. I can finish six proposals at the end of my day and know they’re accurate and consistent every time.”\n\nBy turning hours of manual proposal work into minutes, Banks helps the team move faster, stay consistent, and scale without adding headcount.\n\nAt The Xcite Group, their Custom AI Employee Klaygent was trained on years of internal advertising data, pricing models, and campaign strategies. According to co-founder Michael Klabon:\n\n“Our Custom AI Employee, Klaygent, turned years of internal knowledge into something the whole team can use. Klaygent helps us respond quickly with smarter recommendations, and that has made a noticeable difference in our sales process.”\n\nKlaygent gives every team member access to expert-level insight instantly, helping the company respond faster, close deals more effectively, and deliver a more consistent customer experience.\n\nThese stories highlight how Custom AI Employees help small businesses standardize key workflows, improve customer touchpoints, and unlock new levels of productivity without expanding their workforce.\n\nWhat’s Next for Vendasta\n\nIn the coming months, Vendasta plans to expand the AI workforce with additional out-of-the-box AI Employees for common roles—such as managing business reputation, supporting sales operations, and delivering deeper analytical insights—while continuing to give businesses the flexibility to build fully custom AI Employees for their unique needs. These efforts will be supported by expanded integrations with third-party apps and deeper orchestration capabilities, enabling AI Employees to connect across systems and automate entire workflows end to end.  \n  \nBusinesses and partners can start creating their first Custom AI Employee today at [https://www.vendasta.com/ai-workforce/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=r9TDAI-d8mGc9tb4TbiNG111qLw6MZnjKxgH9QYyzGV5JSMVIkDmaP3I_T9fYSv_AnZMqITBKplsXpHFZkjx_bM8uQiSTwiw77Gz7fPjF8rPejEaLJQMtJ2xrGDo8OhKYrDKo-hpIoyUGSIGByvCyw==).

The prevailing fear has been that generative AI, with its uncanny ability to write, code, analyze, and create, would trigger a mass extinction event for employment, starting with the truck driver and ending with the software engineer.\n\nHowever, as we stand firmly in the midst of the 2024–2025 AI investment cycle, the data tells a radically different story. We are not witnessing the destruction of the workforce; we are witnessing its reconstruction. The \"AI Revolution\" is proving to be less of a demolition derby and more of a massive, capital-intensive construction project—one that is pouring concrete, wiring servers, and rewriting the fundamental code of [American business productivity](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/enterprise-coding-ai-milestone-2025).\n\nA comprehensive analysis of labor market data, investment flows, and sector-specific trends reveals that AI-related investment is creating substantially more jobs than it is eliminating. The ratio is staggering: for every job lost to AI displacement in 2024, approximately ten new jobs were created in the sprawling ecosystem required to build, maintain, and integrate these technologies.1 Far from a collapse, we are seeing a \"construction boom\" of historic proportions, a counter-intuitive rise in wages for the very white-collar roles predicted to vanish, and a strategic pivot in the enterprise toward custom integration that prioritizes human-centric engineering.\n\n![Image 3: AI & The Workforce: Myth vs. Reality](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/ai-workforce-myth-vs-reality-job-growth-2024.PNG)\n\nOverview of job gains, displacement, and wage growth related to AI exposure and construction roles in 2024-2025.\n\nThis report serves as a definitive guide for B2B executives—CTOs, CFOs, and strategic leaders—who must navigate this new terrain. We will dismantle the myths of displacement, explore the physics of the data center boom that is employing armies of skilled tradespeople, and dissect the \"Exposure Paradox\" where high-tech vulnerability translates into higher wages. Furthermore, we will examine the critical role of agile, [custom software development](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/software-product-development-services)—the kind championed by firms like ****Baytech Consulting****—in bridging the gap between raw AI potential and real-world business value.\n\nThe verdict is clear: The robots aren't coming for our jobs; they are creating a massive waiting list for new ones.\n\n![Image 4: Impact of AI on Job Market and Wage Growth](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/ai-job-market-growth-wage-premium-2024.png)\n1. The Macro Labor Market: A Reality Check on Displacement\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo understand the true impact of AI on the workforce, we must first look at the aggregate numbers. The gap between the _perception_ of AI-driven layoffs and the _reality_ of AI-driven hiring is the defining economic divergence of our time.\n\n### 1.1 The 10:1 Creation Ratio\n\nThe headline statistic for 2024–2025 is unequivocal: AI activity created an estimated**119,900 direct U.S. jobs**in 2024 alone.1 These are not speculative projections for a distant future; these are payroll-generating positions filled by real people today. They span a diverse spectrum of the economy, from the highly visible machine learning engineers developing the next iteration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the often-overlooked electrical foremen managing the power grids of hyperscale data centers.\n\nIn stark contrast, the number of jobs eliminated by AI—where a human role was directly substituted by an algorithmic process—was estimated at roughly**12,700**for the same period.1 This yields a creation-to-destruction ratio of nearly**10:1**.\n\n**Table 1: The AI Employment Balance Sheet (2024 Estimates)**\n\nComparison of AI's perceived negative impact on jobs versus the actual job growth and wage premiums driven by AI-related industries in 2024.\n\n| Category | Estimated Jobs Impacted | Description | Ratio |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Jobs Created** | **119,900** | Direct roles in AI development, data center construction, and systems integration. | **10** |\n| **Jobs Eliminated** | **12,700** | Roles directly displaced by automation or AI efficiency gains. | **1** |\n| **Net Gain** | **+107,200** | The positive delta added to the U.S. labor force. | N/A |\n\nSource Data: Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) 1\n\nThis ratio challenges the fundamental premise of \"technological unemployment.\" While it is true that specific tasks are being automated, the net result of the technology's deployment is a significant demand for labor to build the infrastructure and software layers required to make AI useful.\n\n### 1.2 Putting Layoffs in Context\n\nThe fear of AI layoffs is often amplified by high-profile announcements from tech giants. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the total U.S. labor market, AI-driven displacement is statistically negligible.\n\nThe 12,700 jobs lost to AI in 2024 represented approximately**0.1% of all U.S. layoffs**that year.1 To put this in perspective, the vast majority of job losses were driven by traditional macroeconomic factors: interest rate sensitivity, post-pandemic rightsizing, corporate restructuring, and standard business churn.\n\nData from Challenger, Gray & Christmas supports this view. Through November 2025, employers announced**54,694 layoffs**explicitly attributed to AI.2 While this number is rising—and reflects a real and painful transition for those affected—it remains a small fraction of the more than**1.1 million total job cuts**announced over that period.2\n\n**Insight:** The narrative that AI is the primary driver of unemployment is a distortion. Executives who base their workforce planning on the assumption of inevitable mass redundancy are misreading the market. The real challenge for 2025 is not managing a surplus of labor, but competing for talent in a market where [AI skills](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/the-ai-trust-paradox-software-development-2025) —and the \"blue-collar\" skills needed to power AI—are in critically short supply.\n\n### 1.3 The Historical Echo\n\nThis pattern—fear of displacement followed by explosive job creation—is not unprecedented. It echoes the introduction of the ATM in the banking sector. When Automated Teller Machines were introduced, the prediction was that bank tellers would disappear. Instead, the cost of operating a branch fell, banks opened more branches, and the number of tellers actually _increased_, though their jobs shifted from counting cash to customer relationship management.\n\nWe are seeing a similar \"ATM Effect\" in the AI economy. The cost of generating intelligence (content, code, analysis) is falling, which is increasing the demand for the applications of that intelligence. This demand is driving the need for [custom software developers](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/software-consultancy-services), data architects, and systems integrators who can tailor these cheap cognitive resources into valuable business products.\n\n2. The Physical Reality: The Data Center Construction Boom\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the digital impact of AI is debated in boardrooms and on social media, its physical impact is undeniable in the mud and steel of construction sites across North America. The training and operation of massive AI models require unprecedented amounts of compute power, triggering a capital expenditure (CapEx) boom that rivals the great infrastructure projects of the 20th century.\n\nThe AI era is driving tens of thousands of new construction jobs building America’s digital backbone.\n\n### 2.1 The Scale of the Build-Out\n\nThe \"cloud\" is not an abstract concept; it is a physical network of massive industrial facilities filled with servers, cooling systems, and power distribution units. The shift to AI has supercharged the demand for these facilities.\n\nThe ITIF analysis attributes over**110,000 U.S. construction jobs**in 2024 directly to data center build-outs.1 These are not short-term gigs; a single large-scale hyperscale data center (like those built by Microsoft, Google, or Amazon) requires a workforce of roughly**1,500 on-site workers**and can take up to three years to complete.1\n\n**Key Drivers of Construction Intensity:**\n\n*   **Power Density:** AI server racks consume significantly more power than traditional web hosting servers. This requires complex, heavy-duty electrical infrastructure.\n*   **Cooling Requirements:** The heat generated by GPU clusters (like NVIDIA's H100s) often necessitates liquid cooling systems, requiring specialized plumbing and HVAC expertise. 4\n*   **Redundancy:** These facilities are \"mission-critical,\" meaning they require redundant power supplies, backup generators, and fortified physical security, all of which increase the labor intensity of construction.\n\n### 2.2 The \"Blue-Collar\" AI Salary Premium\n\nThe most immediate beneficiaries of the AI boom are not just Silicon Valley software engineers, but the skilled tradespeople building the physical backbone of the internet. The scarcity of labor in the construction sector, combined with the urgent deadlines of tech giants racing for AI supremacy, has led to a significant wage spike.\n\n![Image 5: Data Center Wage Premium Table (Visual Style)](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/data-center-wage-premium-infographic.jpg)\n\nData center projects bring higher pay: many skilled tradespeople now earn tech-sector salaries.\n\nConstruction workers moving onto AI data center projects can earn**25–30% higher pay**compared to standard commercial construction.1 In dollar terms, this can translate to a premium of nearly**$10 more per hour**.1\n\n**Table 2: The Data Center Wage Premium**\n\n| Role | Standard Commercial Pay (Est.) | Data Center Project Pay (Est.) | Premium |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **General Construction** | ~$29.80/hr | ~$39.33/hr | **+32%** |\n| **Electrician (Specialized)** | 70,000 - 90,000/yr | 100,000 - 140,000/yr | **+40-50%** |\n| **Project Manager** | 90,000 - 110,000/yr | 120,000 - 180,000/yr | **+30-60%** |\n\nSource Data: Skillit, The Wall Street Journal, ITIF 5\n\nThis wage inflation is creating a new class of \"blue-collar tech workers.\" In regions like Northern Virginia (Data Center Alley) and Oregon, electricians and foremen are earning annual compensations exceeding**$200,000**when overtime and bonuses are factored in.6 To attract talent, construction firms are offering perks previously associated with the tech sector, such as signing bonuses, daily incentive pay, and high-quality on-site amenities.6\n\n### 2.3 Regional Shifts: The \"Traveler\" Workforce\n\nThe boom is reshaping the economic geography of the United States. While Northern Virginia remains the global capital, the demand for power and land is pushing development into the Midwest and the South.\n\n*   **Louisiana:** The state saw a record **$61 billion** in capital investment in 2025, largely driven by energy and digital infrastructure projects, including a massive $10 billion AI data center by Hut 8. 9\n*   **The Midwest:** States like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin are seeing a surge in proposals, though this is often met with local resistance regarding water usage and grid strain. 11\n*   **The \"Traveler\" Phenomenon:** The localized intensity of these projects often outstrips the local labor supply. This has revived the \"traveler\" workforce—skilled tradespeople who migrate from project to project, living in temporary housing or RVs, chasing the high wages and overtime offered by the AI rush. 6\n\nThis physical build-out is the foundation of the AI economy. Before a single line of AI code can generate revenue, a welder must fuse a pipe and an electrician must wire a server rack.\n\n3. The \"Exposure Paradox\": Why Vulnerable Jobs Are Growing\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMoving from the physical to the digital workforce, we encounter the most counter-intuitive finding of the 2024–2025 period. Economic theory and sci-fi predictions suggested that jobs with high exposure to AI—such as data analysis, copywriting, and administrative support—would be the first to collapse.\n\nThe data reveals the exact opposite. This phenomenon, which we term the **\"Exposure Paradox,\"** suggests that high exposure to AI currently correlates with _higher_ job growth and _higher_ wage growth.\n\n![Image 6: Wage Growth in AI-Exposed Jobs (Exposure Paradox)](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/ai-exposure-wage-growth-chart.jpg)\n\n‘Augmented’ workers whose jobs are AI-exposed are earning higher wages than less-exposed peers.\n\n### 3.1 Growth Where Decline Was Predicted\n\nResearch from Vanguard, analyzing labor market trends from mid-2023 to mid-2025, turns the conventional wisdom on its head. Employment in occupations with**high AI exposure grew by 1.7%**, significantly outpacing the 0.8% to 1% growth seen in less-exposed occupations.12\n\nInstead of shrinking, roles like office clerks, HR assistants, and junior data analysts are expanding. Why?\n\n*   **Induced Demand:** As AI lowers the cost of performing a task (e.g., analyzing a dataset), the demand for that task increases. Companies are doing _more_ analysis, _more_ content creation, and _more_ customer outreach because it is cheaper to do so, requiring more humans to manage the process.\n*   **The \"Augmentation\" Effect:** AI is removing the drudgery of these roles—data entry, basic summarization, syntax correction—allowing professionals to focus on higher-value problem solving. This makes these workers more productive and, consequently, more valuable to their employers.\n\n### 3.2 The Wage Premium for \"AI-Exposed\" Talent\n\nThe most striking metric is wage growth. Real wages in AI-exposed fields have accelerated to**3.8%**in the post-pandemic era (2023–2025). Compare this to the meager**0.1%**growth rate these same roles saw prior to the pandemic, and the**0.7%**growth in less-exposed occupations today.13\n\n**Table 3: Wage Growth by AI Exposure Level**\n\n| Metric | High AI Exposure Occupations | Low AI Exposure Occupations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Real Wage Growth (2023–2025)** | **+3.8%** | +0.7% |\n| **Employment Growth (2023–2025)** | **+1.7%** | +0.8% |\n| **Pre-Pandemic Wage Growth** | +0.1% | (Historical Baseline) |\n\nSource Data: Vanguard Research 13\n\n**Insight for Executives:** This data suggests a \"skill-biased\" shift. The market is paying a premium for workers who can leverage AI tools to amplify their output. The [\"augmented\" worker](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/automation-paradox-smarter-humans-in-ai)—a developer using GitHub Copilot, a marketer using Jasper, a legal aide using Harvey—is generating more value per hour than their non-augmented peers. Executives should focus not on replacing workers with AI, but on _equipping_ workers with AI to capture this productivity dividend.\n\n4. The Iceberg Index: Quantifying the Hidden Potential\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the data center boom is the visible tip of the AI economy, the \"Iceberg Index\" developed by MIT researchers represents the massive, submerged potential for transformation that lies beneath the surface. Understanding this index is crucial for strategic planning, as it identifies _where_ the next wave of efficiency gains will come from.\n\n![Image 7: The Iceberg Index: Hidden Automation Potential](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/iceberg-index-ai-automation-potential.jpg)\n\nMost of AI’s automation potential is submerged: efficiencies for finance, admin, and logistics jobs across the country.\n\n### 4.1 Capability vs. Displacement\n\nThe MIT study uses the \"Iceberg Index\" to measure the _technical capability_ of AI to perform tasks currently done by humans. Their findings are sobering but nuanced:\n\n*   AI is technically capable of automating tasks performed by **11.7% of the U.S. workforce**.\n*   This represents approximately**$1.2 trillion in wages**.15\n\nHowever, the report emphasizes a critical distinction: **Technical capability is not economic inevitability.** Just because a task _can_ be automated does not mean it _will_ be immediately.\n\n*   **Economic Friction:** It may still be cheaper to have a human do a task than to license, train, and maintain a complex AI agent.\n*   **Integration Challenges:** Connecting an AI model to legacy enterprise systems (often running on decades-old tech) is difficult and costly.\n*   **Regulatory Barriers:** In sectors like healthcare and finance, \"human-in-the-loop\" requirements slow down full automation. 19\n\n### 4.2 The \"Hidden\" Geography of Tech\n\nOne of the most profound insights from the Iceberg Index is the geographic shift of tech exposure. Traditionally, \"tech disruption\" was viewed as a coastal phenomenon affecting Silicon Valley, Seattle, and New York.\n\nThe Iceberg Index reveals that **white-collar exposure is nationwide**. Administrative, financial, and logistical tasks—the \"back office\" of the American economy—are distributed across every state.\n\n*   **Surprising Hotspots:** States like **Delaware** (finance/corporate registration), **South Dakota** (banking operations), and **Utah** (admin/tech services) show _higher_ Iceberg Index values than California. 19\n*   **The \"Surface\" vs. \"Submerged\":** MIT classifies visible tech disruption (layoffs in Big Tech, coding automation) as the \"Surface Index,\" which accounts for only about 2.2% of total wage value ($211 billion). The \"submerged\" portion—administrative and professional services—is **five times larger**. 21\n\n**Strategic Implication:** For B2B firms, the biggest ROI for AI adoption is likely not in your IT department, but in your operations, finance, and HR departments. Automating the \"boring\" back-office workflows in Sioux Falls or Wilmington offers a massive, untapped reservoir of efficiency.\n\n5. Enterprise Strategy: The \"Build vs. Buy\" Pivot and the Role of Custom Software\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the C-suite, the question has moved from \"Should we use AI?\" to \"[How do we implement AI without failing?](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/revolutionizing-software-security-2025)\" The 2024–2025 period has been a crucible of hard lessons regarding enterprise AI adoption.\n\n### 5.1 The Failure of the \"Science Project\"\n\nGartner and other analysts report high failure rates for initial GenAI projects. Estimates suggest that between**40% and 85%**of AI projects fail to move from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.22 The \"Science Project\" era—where companies hired PhDs to build proprietary Large Language Models from scratch—is ending.\n\n**Primary Causes of Failure:**\n\n1.   **Data Quality:** 64% of organizations cite data quality as their top barrier. \"Garbage in, hallucination out\" has become the hard reality. 24\n2.   **Governance Gaps:** The inability to secure data or explain model decisions halts deployment. 25\n3.   **Lack of Integration:** A brilliant model that sits in a silo, unconnected to the ERP or CRM, provides zero business value.\n\n### 5.2 The Strategic Pivot: Buy Intelligence, Build Integration\n\nIn response to these failures, 2025 sees a massive strategic swing. Approximately**76% of enterprises**are now opting to \"buy\" ready-made intelligence (via APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, or Google) or \"integrate\" best-of-breed solutions rather than building models from the ground up.26\n\nHowever, \"buying\" doesn't mean just purchasing a SaaS subscription. It drives a massive demand for **custom software development**. The competitive advantage is no longer the model itself (which is becoming a commodity); it is the **integration layer**—the custom software that connects the AI brain to the company's proprietary data and workflows.\n\n![Image 8: Enterprise AI Strategy: Buy & Integrate Custom Solutions](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/enterprise-ai-strategy-custom-integration.jpg)\n\nIn 2025, most firms succeed by buying ready-made AI and building custom software layers to connect them to business needs.\n\n### 5.3 The Baytech Paradigm: Custom-Crafted Tech Advantage\n\nThis shift plays directly to the strengths of specialized firms like ****Baytech Consulting****. In an era where off-the-shelf software rarely fits the nuanced needs of a complex enterprise, the \"Tailored Tech Advantage\" becomes a critical differentiator.\n\n**Why Custom Development is Essential for AI Success:**\n\n*   **Data Orchestration:** To make an AI model useful, data must be pulled from SQL Servers, Postgres databases, and legacy systems, cleaned, and contextualized. This requires robust backend engineering using tools like **Azure DevOps**, **Kubernetes**, and **Docker**—core competencies of firms like Baytech.\n*   **Security and Governance:** Executives cannot simply paste sensitive customer data into a public chatbot. Custom solutions allow for the deployment of private instances (e.g., via **OVHCloud** or private Azure tenants) protected by enterprise-grade firewalls (like **pfSense**) and strict role-based access controls.\n*   **Agile Adaptation:** The AI field moves at breakneck speed. A monolithic 2-year software project will be obsolete before it launches. The **Rapid Agile Deployment** methodology ensures that software evolves alongside the AI models, delivering value in weeks, not years.\n\nThe Tech Stack of 2025:\n\nSuccessful AI integration isn't just about Python scripts. It requires a robust enterprise stack:\n\n*   **Containerization:****Docker** and **Kubernetes** (managed via **Rancher**) are standard for deploying AI microservices that can scale with demand.\n*   **Data Integrity:****SQL Server** and **Postgres** (managed via **pgAdmin**) remain the bedrock of truth. AI is the engine, but structured data is the fuel.\n*   **Development Environment:****VS Code** and **Visual Studio 2022** have become the cockpits for AI-augmented development, allowing engineers to weave AI copilots directly into their workflow.\n\n**Actionable Advice:** Do not try to be an AI research lab. Be an AI _engineering_ shop. Buy the smartest model you can afford, and invest your budget in the custom software \"glue\" that makes that model work for your specific business case.\n\n6. The Talent War 2.0: From Researchers to Builders\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAs the market matures, the profile of the \"ideal hire\" is changing. We are moving from the \"Scientific Phase\" (inventing the math) to the \"Engineering Phase\" (building the product).\n\n### 6.1 The Rise of the \"AI Architect\"\n\nIn 2023, the war for talent was fought over PhDs in machine learning. In 2025, the battlefield has shifted to application and integration.\n\n*   **Automation Overtakes Development:** In Q3 2025, automation-related positions represented **44% of all AI job postings**, overtaking pure AI development roles for the first time. 28\n*   **The \"Hybrid\" Skill Set:** Companies are seeking \"AI Architects\" or \"AI Systems Engineers\"—professionals who can stitch together LLMs, vector databases, and front-end applications. They need to understand **APIs**, **latency**, **token costs**, and **user experience** as much as they understand neural networks. 29\n\n### 6.2 The Entry-Level Crisis and Opportunity\n\n![Image 9: Reimagining Entry-Level Training: Editors-in-Chief of AI](https://dzrge5zzbsh6q.cloudfront.net/entry-level-retraining-ai-auditors.jpg)\n\nEntry-level roles are evolving: new hires are trained to audit and enhance AI outputs, building critical thinking early in their careers.\n\nA concern emerging from the data is the pressure on entry-level roles. Vanguard's analysis notes that while experienced workers are seeing wage gains, hiring for entry-level positions has slowed.30 The \"grunt work\" that used to train junior analysts—summarizing reports, writing basic code, data entry—is exactly what AI does best.\n\nThe Challenge: How do companies train the next generation of senior experts if the junior rung of the ladder is automated?\n\nThe Solution: Forward-thinking firms are shifting entry-level training from \"task execution\" to \"AI oversight.\" Junior staff are being taught to audit AI outputs rather than generate the raw material themselves. They are becoming \"Editors-in-Chief\" of AI-generated work, requiring critical thinking skills earlier in their careers.32\n\n7. Conclusion: The Blueprint for 2026\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe data from 2024 and 2025 dismantling the \"Jobapocalypse\" narrative is not an invitation to complacency; it is a call to action. We are witnessing a ****Great Reallocation**** of human potential. The economy is shedding low-value tasks and creating high-value roles at a ratio of 10:1.\n\nFor the B2B executive, the path forward involves three strategic pillars:\n\n1.   **Invest in Infrastructure:** Whether it's the physical data center or the digital cloud environment, your foundation must be robust.\n2.   **Empower, Don't Replace:** Use AI to augment your workforce. The wage data proves that \"centaur\" employees (human + AI) are the most valuable assets in the market.\n3.   **Build the Bridge:** Leverage [custom software development](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/software-outsourcing-strategies-for-effective-development) to bridge the gap between generic AI models and your specific business needs. Partner with experts who understand the engineering reality—the \"plumbing\" of DevOps, data integrity, and secure deployment—that makes AI viable.\n\nThe future isn't about humans _versus_ machines. It's about humans _building_ the machines that build the future. And right now, business is booming.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\nQ: Is AI actually replacing jobs right now, or is it just hype?\n\nA: The data confirms that AI is a net job creator by a significant margin. In 2024, AI activity created roughly 119,900 jobs (primarily in development and infrastructure construction) while displacing approximately 12,700 jobs. This creates a 10:1 ratio of gains to losses. While individual displacement is real, it represents only 0.1% of total U.S. layoffs. The primary economic engine right now is the massive \"build-out\" phase—construction, power, and implementation—which is labor-intensive.\n\nQ: Why are wages rising in jobs that AI is supposed to automate?\n\nA: This is the \"Exposure Paradox.\" In many white-collar roles (finance, analysis, admin), AI isn't replacing the worker; it's replacing the boring parts of the worker's day. This makes the worker more productive. Vanguard's research shows that real wages in high-AI-exposure jobs grew by 3.8% post-COVID, compared to just 0.7% in low-exposure jobs. Companies are paying a premium for professionals who can leverage AI to amplify their output.\n\nQ: Should our company build our own AI model or buy off-the-shelf?\n\nA: For most B2B firms, building a foundation model from scratch is a strategic error. The 2025 trend is \"[Buy and Integrate](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/ais-new-era-why-waiting-is-no-longer-an-option-2025).\" Approximately 76% of enterprises are choosing to use existing powerful models (like GPT-4 or Claude) and integrate them. The sweet spot is Custom Integration—using firms like Baytech Consulting to build the custom software layer that connects these models to your proprietary data and workflows securely.\n\nQ: What is the \"Iceberg Index\" and why does it matter?\n\nA: The Iceberg Index is an MIT metric measuring the \"hidden\" potential for automation. It finds that 11.7% of the U.S. economy is technically ready for AI automation, but most of this isn't in Silicon Valley—it's in finance, healthcare administration, and logistics in states like Delaware and South Dakota. This highlights that the biggest ROI for AI is likely in automating your back-office operations to unlock efficiency.\n\nQ: What is the #1 reason AI projects fail in 2025?\n\nA: Data Quality. Roughly 64% of organizations cite poor data quality as their primary barrier. If internal data is unstructured or \"messy,\" even the smartest AI will fail. Successful implementation starts with data governance—often requiring custom software solutions (using tools like SQL Server and Postgres) to structure data before the AI touches it.\n\nSupporting Resources\n--------------------\n\n*   [](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/ai-revolution-2025-building-future-workforce)[https://itif.org/publications/2025/12/18/ais-job-impact-gains-outpace-losses/](https://itif.org/publications/2025/12/18/ais-job-impact-gains-outpace-losses/)\n*   [](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/ai-revolution-2025-building-future-workforce)[https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf)\n*   [](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/ai-revolution-2025-building-future-workforce)[https://iceberg.mit.edu/report.pdf](https://iceberg.mit.edu/report.pdf)\n\nAbout Baytech\n-------------\n\nAt [Baytech Consulting](https://www.baytechconsulting.com/services/partnership-approach-baytech-consulting), we specialize in guiding businesses through this process, helping you build scalable, efficient, and high-performing software that evolves with your needs.

Here are some practical ways students can use AI:\n\n1. **Fact-Checking and Critical Thinking:**\n\n   * Students can use AI chatbots like ChatGPT to fact-check information. Instead of blindly accepting AI-generated responses, they can critically evaluate and verify the accuracy of answers.\n2. **Writing and Brainstorming:**\n\n   * AI can serve as a brainstorming tool for creative writing. Students can use it to generate ideas, prompts, or keywords.\n3. **Language Learning and Translation:**\n\n   * AI language models can help students practice foreign languages. AI language models can generate sentences, provide translations, and offer language exercises.\n4. **Personalized Learning Paths**:\n\n   * AI-driven adaptive learning platforms tailor content to individual student needs. These tools recommend relevant resources, quizzes, and exercises based on performance.\n5. **Automated Proofreading and Grammar Checking:**\n\n   * AI can assist students in improving their writing by highlighting grammar errors, suggesting corrections, and enhancing clarity.\n\nRemember that while AI offers exciting possibilities, students should also develop critical thinking skills to evaluate AI-generated content, and use it responsibly.\n\n## Inappropriate Uses of AI\n\n**Inappropriate Uses of AI**\n\nDo not use AI applications without the permission of your professor! Here are some inappropriate uses of AI.\n\n1. **Using Biased Information****:**\n\n   * While AI, in theory, is meant to be unbiased, it can only work with the data given, and that data reflects the unconscious bias of its creators, as well as, the AI creators. In several instances, bias has been on stark display in AI tools. One example is AI algorithms sending tech job openings to men but not women. Vet AI output before you use it! Does the AI output you are reading contain biases? If it does, do not use the information!\n2. **Plagiarism****:**\n\n   * Plagiarism includes copying someone else's work and misrepresenting it as your own. If you take output from an AI and include it your paper without providing a citation that shows you got the information from an AI, you could be committing plagiarism, which is like cheating.\n3. **Spreading Fake News****:**\n\n   * Some of the information AI's are trained on comes from the Internet. You will not be surprised that if the AI you are using pulls sources with mis or disinformation from the Internet, you could have output from an AI that is full of mis or disinformation. Check the accuracy of the output of any AI tool before you use it!\n4. ****Infringing On Copyright****:\n\n   * AI tools use content from the internet to generate their output. Generative AI output is not automatically copyrighted in the US. Remember that an AI like ChatGPT may pull content from a copyrighted source or emulate it. For example, if you prompt a text-generating AI tool like ChatGPT to create a song similar to Leonard Cohen's \"Anthem\", or ask an image-generating AI tool like DALL-E to create an image using the style of a contemporary artist, you may be infringing copyright as AI tools draw from the existing works and reproduce derivatives of them.\n\n* [<< **Previous:** What is ChatGPT?](https://ulm.libguides.com/c.php?g=1409300&p=10435404)\n* [**Next:** Using AI Effectively >>](https://ulm.libguides.com/c.php?g=1409300&p=10528377)\n\n* Last Updated: Sep 30, 2025 2:32 PM\n* URL: https://ulm.libguides.com/AIStudents\n* [Print Page](javascript: window.print();)\n\n[Login to LibApps](https://ulm.libapps.com/libapps/login.php?site_id=24877&target64=L2xpYmd1aWRlcy9hZG1pbl9jLnBocD9nPTE0MDkzMDAmcD0xMDQzNTQwNQ==)\n\n[Report a problem](mailto:reference@ulm.edu)\n\nSubjects: [Artificial Intelligence](https://ulm.libguides.com/sb.php?subject_id=246050)\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Follow us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ULM.Library/) | [Follow us on X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ULMLibrary) |"

Measuring AI's impact on decision quality requires tracking specific, actionable metrics that go beyond simple adoption rates. The five core metrics—accuracy, relevance, coherence, helpfulness, and user trust—provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating whether AI-generated answers genuinely enhance business decisions. By systematically measuring these dimensions, organizations can quantify improvements in decision speed, quality, and confidence while identifying areas where AI systems need refinement. This approach transforms AI from a promising technology into a measurable driver of better business outcomes.\n\n## Glean: AI-powered answers driving better decisions\n\nGlean delivers AI-powered enterprise search that fundamentally changes how knowledge workers access information and make decisions. Instead of forcing employees to hunt across disconnected systems, Glean unifies knowledge from over 100 applications and delivers context-aware answers directly within existing workflows. This AI for decision-making approach eliminates the productivity drain of context switching while dismantling the information silos that slow critical business processes.\n\nThe platform's architecture relies on retrieval augmented generation, which grounds every AI-generated answer in verified company data rather than generic training information. This ensures responses reflect your organization's specific policies, procedures, and institutional knowledge while maintaining compliance and security standards. When a product manager asks about customer feedback trends or a support engineer needs troubleshooting guidance, Glean surfaces answers anchored in actual company documents, tickets, and communications.\n\nOrganizations implementing Glean report measurable improvements across key decision-making indicators. Teams spend less time searching for information, support tickets resolve faster, and employees express higher confidence in the answers they receive. By establishing baseline metrics before deployment and tracking changes afterward, companies can quantify exactly how AI-powered answers improve decision quality and operational efficiency.\n\n## Accuracy: measuring correctness and reliability\n\nAccuracy forms the foundation of trustworthy AI-generated answers because decisions based on incorrect information can lead to costly mistakes, compliance failures, and eroded confidence. In high-stakes environments like financial services, healthcare, or legal operations, even small accuracy gaps can trigger significant consequences.\n\nAccuracy measures how often an AI response matches authoritative sources or expert answers. According to [research on AI performance measurement](https://neontri.com/blog/measure-ai-performance/), organizations should track the factual error rate—the percentage of responses containing incorrect information—alongside positive accuracy scores. For customer service workflows, this might mean comparing AI-generated troubleshooting steps against documented procedures. In fraud detection systems, it means measuring how often AI correctly identifies suspicious transactions.\n\nImplementing accuracy measurement requires establishing ground truth benchmarks. Create a test set of questions with verified correct answers and regularly evaluate AI responses against these standards. Track accuracy rates across different content domains, user groups, and query types to identify patterns. A customer support AI might achieve 95% accuracy on product specification questions but only 78% on complex troubleshooting scenarios, revealing where additional training data or human oversight is needed.\n\nSeveral technical metrics support accuracy assessment. Faithfulness scores, as outlined in [Clarivate's evaluation framework](https://clarivate.com/academia-government/blog/evaluating-the-quality-of-generative-ai-output-methods-metrics-and-best-practices/), measure how closely AI-generated content corresponds to source documents. For text generation tasks, BLEU and ROUGE scores quantify similarity between AI outputs and reference texts. Organizations should display accuracy metrics in dashboards that track trends over time, making it easy to spot degradation and validate improvements after system updates.\n\nBuilding AI reliability requires continuous monitoring. Establish accuracy thresholds for different use cases—perhaps 99% for compliance-related queries but 90% for general information requests—and trigger reviews when performance drops below acceptable levels. This systematic approach to measuring correctness ensures AI-generated answers consistently support decision quality improvement rather than introducing new risks.\n\n## Relevance: aligning answers with user needs\n\nAn accurate answer that fails to address the user's actual question wastes time and frustrates employees. Relevance measures whether AI-generated responses directly address user intent within the specific business context, ensuring the information provided enables rather than distracts.\n\nRelevance captures the degree to which an AI response matches what the user actually needs to know. A sales representative asking \"What's our discount policy for enterprise customers?\" needs specific approval thresholds and process steps, not a general overview of all company discounts. The most relevant answer anticipates the user's workflow and provides exactly the information required for their next action.\n\nImplementing relevance measurement typically involves rating scales that capture user judgment. Many organizations use a 1-5 relevance score where users evaluate how well each AI response addressed their specific need. According to [guidance on AI evaluations](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-to-implement-effective-ai-evaluations/), structured scoring rubrics help standardize these assessments:\n\n`| Score | Definition | User action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 | Perfectly addresses the question with actionable information | Immediately applies the answer |\n| 4 | Mostly relevant with minor gaps | Uses answer with minimal additional searching |\n| 3 | Partially relevant but missing key details | Requires supplementary research |\n| 2 | Tangentially related but doesn't answer the question | Starts new search |\n| 1 | Completely irrelevant or off-topic | Abandons AI system |`\n\nTrack relevance scores across query categories, user roles, and time periods to identify patterns. If marketing teams consistently rate AI response relevance higher than engineering teams, the system may need additional technical documentation or domain-specific training. Declining relevance scores over time signal AI drift, where model performance degrades as business context evolves.\n\nUser feedback loops optimize relevance continuously. When users rate responses poorly, capture their comments about what was missing or unhelpful. Analyze this qualitative data alongside quantitative scores to understand whether relevance issues stem from incomplete knowledge bases, poor query understanding, or misaligned ranking algorithms. Organizations that systematically improve AI response relevance see measurable increases in user satisfaction and reduced time spent searching for information.\n\n## Coherence: ensuring logical and clear responses\n\nCoherence determines whether users can actually understand and act on AI-generated answers. Even accurate, relevant information loses value when presented in confusing, disjointed, or illogical formats. Measuring coherence ensures AI responses support effective decision-making through clear communication.\n\nCoherence refers to the logical structure and narrative flow of AI-generated content. A coherent answer presents information in a sequence that makes sense, uses consistent terminology, maintains focus on the topic, and connects ideas smoothly. When an employee asks about expense reimbursement procedures, a coherent response walks through the process step-by-step rather than jumping between unrelated policy details.\n\nAssessing coherence combines automated metrics with human evaluation. Perplexity scores, commonly used in [generative AI evaluation](https://medium.com/genusoftechnology/evaluating-generative-ai-a-comprehensive-guide-with-metrics-methods-visual-examples-2824347bfac3), measure how predictable and natural text appears—lower perplexity indicates content that flows logically. Readability metrics like Flesch-Kincaid scores help ensure answers match the audience's comprehension level.\n\nHuman reviewers provide essential coherence assessment that automated metrics miss. Establish a review checklist that evaluates:\n\n* Information is presented in logical order\n* Transitions between points are smooth and clear\n* Technical terms are used consistently\n* The response maintains focus without tangents\n* Conclusions follow logically from supporting details\n* Formatting enhances rather than obscures meaning\n\nSample responses should be evaluated regularly across different query types and content domains. If AI-generated answers about technical specifications consistently score high on coherence while HR policy responses score low, the system may need better training on how to structure procedural information. Track coherence metrics alongside accuracy and relevance to understand whether comprehension issues stem from incorrect information or simply unclear presentation.\n\nOrganizations that prioritize coherence see higher engagement with AI-generated answers. When users can quickly understand and apply the information provided, they're more likely to trust the system and integrate it into their decision-making workflows. Clear, logically structured responses reduce the cognitive load of processing information, enabling faster and more confident decisions.\n\n## Helpfulness: supporting effective user action\n\nHelpfulness represents the ultimate measure of AI-generated answers' value—whether the response actually enables users to accomplish their goals and make better decisions. An answer can be accurate, relevant, and coherent yet still fail to help if it doesn't provide actionable guidance.\n\nHelpfulness measures the extent to which an AI-generated answer moves users closer to completing their task or making their decision. This goes beyond information delivery to assess practical utility in real business scenarios. When a customer service agent receives an AI-generated answer about product returns, helpfulness depends on whether that answer includes the specific steps, system commands, and exception handling necessary to actually process the return.\n\nImplementing helpfulness measurement requires understanding user workflows and success criteria. Prompt users to rate answers on a 1-5 scale specifically focused on utility: \"Did this answer help you complete your task or make your decision?\" According to [research on AI evaluation methods](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-to-implement-effective-ai-evaluations/), this single question often correlates more strongly with business outcomes than complex multi-dimensional rubrics.\n\nConnect helpfulness ratings to downstream performance metrics that demonstrate business impact:\n\n* Task completion rates before and after receiving AI-generated answers\n* Time-to-resolution for support tickets where agents used AI assistance\n* Decision confidence scores from users who consulted AI-generated information\n* Follow-up question frequency, where lower rates suggest the initial answer was sufficiently helpful\n* Abandonment rates when users exit without taking action after viewing AI responses\n\nTrack these metrics across different use cases to identify where AI-generated answers deliver the most value. Sales teams might find AI-assisted decision-making particularly helpful for pricing negotiations, while engineering teams benefit most from troubleshooting guidance. Understanding these patterns enables targeted improvements that maximize AI utility for specific workflows.\n\nQualitative feedback enriches helpfulness assessment. When users rate answers as unhelpful, ask what was missing or what would have made the response more useful. Common themes often emerge: users need more specific examples, clearer action steps, links to relevant tools, or context about when different approaches apply. Addressing these gaps systematically transforms AI from an information source into a genuine decision support system.\n\n## User trust: building confidence through consistent value\n\nUser trust determines whether AI-generated answers become integral to decision-making or remain underutilized technology. Without trust, employees will continue using familiar but less efficient methods, negating AI's potential impact. Measuring and building trust requires understanding both rational confidence in system performance and emotional comfort with AI-assisted decisions.\n\nUser trust reflects the confidence employees have in AI-generated answers' accuracy, reliability, and utility based on consistent positive experiences. Trust builds gradually as users verify that AI responses prove helpful, accurate, and aligned with their needs. It erodes quickly when systems provide incorrect information, irrelevant answers, or fail to deliver promised value.\n\nMeasuring trust combines behavioral signals with direct sentiment assessment. Track repeat usage rates as a primary trust indicator—employees who trust AI-generated answers return to the system regularly and expand their use to new scenarios. According to [research on measuring AI impact](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/how-to-implement-effective-ai-evaluations/), adoption patterns reveal trust levels more reliably than self-reported confidence scores.\n\n|  \n Trust indicator |  \n Measurement approach |  \n Positive trend |  \n\n  \n      \n      \n|  \n Repeat usage rate |  \n Percentage of users returning within 7 days |  \n Increasing over time |  \n\n  \n|  \n Query diversity |  \n Number of different question types per user |  \n Expanding scope |  \n\n  \n|  \n Response acceptance |  \n Percentage of AI answers used without modification |  \n Above 70% |  \n\n  \n|  \n Voluntary adoption |  \n Users choosing AI over alternatives |  \n Growing organically |  \n\n  \n|  \n Recommendation rate |  \n Net Promoter Score for AI system |  \n Positive and rising |\n\n‍\n\nComplement behavioral metrics with direct sentiment measurement. Deploy brief in-app surveys asking users to rate their confidence in AI-generated answers on a 5-point scale. Track changes in sentiment over time, particularly after system updates or training data improvements. Analyze qualitative comments to understand specific trust factors—users might trust AI for factual lookups but not strategic recommendations, revealing opportunities for targeted capability building.\n\nTransparency strengthens user confidence in AI. When Glean surfaces answers, it shows the source documents and explains how information was retrieved. This visibility enables users to verify responses and understand system reasoning, building rational trust through verifiable performance rather than requiring blind faith in algorithmic outputs.\n\nAddress trust erosion immediately when it occurs. If accuracy drops or users report unhelpful responses, acknowledge the issue, explain corrective actions, and demonstrate improvement through updated metrics. Organizations that treat trust as a measurable asset requiring continuous investment see sustained AI adoption and deeper integration into critical decision-making processes.\n\nBuilding long-term trust requires proving value consistently across diverse scenarios and user groups. As employees experience AI-generated answers that save time, improve decision quality, and reduce uncertainty, trust compounds. This virtuous cycle transforms AI from a tool people use occasionally into an essential decision support system they rely on daily.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### What are the key metrics to assess AI-generated answers' impact on decisions?\n\nThe five essential metrics are accuracy, relevance, coherence, helpfulness, and user trust. Accuracy measures factual correctness, relevance assesses alignment with user needs, coherence evaluates logical clarity, helpfulness determines practical utility, and user trust captures sustained confidence in the system. Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of whether AI-generated answers genuinely improve decision quality and business outcomes.\n\n### How can I measure the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated answers?\n\nEstablish ground truth benchmarks by creating test questions with verified correct answers, then regularly evaluate AI responses against these standards. Track factual error rates, faithfulness scores that measure correspondence to source documents, and accuracy percentages across different content domains. Display these metrics in dashboards that reveal trends over time, enabling you to identify degradation quickly and validate improvements after system updates.\n\n### How does AI-driven decision-making affect business performance?\n\nAI-driven decision-making typically improves business performance by accelerating information retrieval, reducing errors, and enabling more confident decisions. Organizations implementing AI-powered answer systems like Glean report measurable gains in task completion speed, support ticket resolution rates, and employee productivity. The key is establishing baseline metrics before AI deployment, then tracking changes in decision speed, quality, and outcomes to quantify the specific performance improvements in your environment.\n\n### What indicates user trust in AI-generated responses?\n\nUser trust manifests through behavioral patterns and direct sentiment. High trust appears in repeat usage rates, expanding query diversity, voluntary adoption without mandates, and positive recommendation scores. Track how often employees return to AI systems, whether they apply answers without verification, and if adoption grows organically across teams. Complement these behavioral signals with periodic surveys measuring confidence levels and analyzing qualitative feedback about specific trust factors.\n\n### How do I compare AI-supported decisions to traditional approaches?\n\nEstablish comparison frameworks that measure the same outcomes before and after AI implementation. Track decision speed, accuracy, user satisfaction, and business results for both traditional methods and AI-assisted approaches. For example, measure average time-to-resolution for support tickets handled with and without AI assistance, or compare sales cycle length for deals where representatives used AI-generated insights versus those who didn't. This controlled comparison quantifies AI's incremental value while accounting for other variables affecting performance.\n\n‍\n\n[Back to all stories](/blog)\n\n[Have questions or want a demo?\n\nWe’re here to help!

Taking the right approach also reduces the chances of an AI project failing, which is an issue that has affected many customers. Taking the right approach is key to not only setting the customer up for a better outcome, but also in helping build a trusted relationship between user and channel partner.\n\n## Why does the AI story start with data?\n\nSome customers will be keen to embrace AI, grabbing what they can and deploying it without doing the planning around data and security. That comes with risks – risks that can be largely avoided by taking a measured approach.\n\n“Before they can integrate AI effectively, organisations must address how they collect, store and manage their unstructured data, particularly at the edge. It is vast, dispersed across multiple silos, and difficult to access and manage efficiently,” says Nick Burling, chief product officer at [Nasuni](https://www.nasuni.com/).\n\n“Unstructured data – the 80-90% of enterprise data consisting of documents and emails, to images, videos and design files – is emerging as the backbone of AI innovation, redefining how enterprises harness intelligence across their organisations. This vast, often underutilised data holds the key to deeper insights, smarter automation, and more contextually aware AI systems. The potential value from unlocking it has never been greater,” adds Burling.\n\nNicole Reineke, AI strategist at [N-Able](https://www.n-able.com/), agrees that the foundations have to be solid if the results are to be meaningful.\n\n“Simply put, AI is math. So, while outputs can be exactly what we we’re looking for, they are still just the result of models trained on data. Which brings us to one of the oldest, truest sayings in computing: garbage in, garbage out,” she says.\n\n“If the training data is biased, incomplete, outdated, or just wrong, like inconsistent ticket notes, vague status fields and knowledge base articles written in 2014, then the AI’s output will reflect that. The bad information is handed back to us, just as a more polished version. If the data you input is wrong, the AI story will be too – the data shapes the story AI tells,” adds Reineke.\n\n## What needs to be done to get data ready for an AI deployment?\n\nOne of the initial challenges is deciphering the customer claims from the reality of their position.\n\n“Our [research](https://www.qlik.com/us/news/company/press-room/press-releases/94-percent-of-businesses-are-investing-more-in-ai-yet-only-21-percent-have-successfully-operationalized-it) shows that  enthusiasm outpaces readiness when it comes to deploying AI. Some 94% of companies are increasing spending on products and services to support data readiness for AI, but only [21%](https://www.qlik.com/us/news/company/press-room/press-releases/94-percent-of-businesses-are-investing-more-in-ai-yet-only-21-percent-have-successfully-operationalized-it) have fully embedded AI into their operations,” says David Zember, senior vice-president of worldwide channels and alliances at [Qlik](https://www.qlik.com/us).\n\nPartners might well have to push the data preparation message to underline the importance of starting off in the right way.\n\n“Data readiness is one of the most overlooked stages of any AI deployment, despite it being a crucial deciding factor in whether the deployment will succeed. To truly become ‘AI ready’ organisations must focus on the visibility, governance and mobility of their data,” says Sonya Matthieu, senior director partner for the UK and Ireland at [NetApp.](http://www.netapp.com/)\n\n“In practice, this requires consolidating any silos and ensuring data is stored in the right place for the right workload. This means whether that’s on-prem, in the public cloud, or even at the edge,” she adds.\n\nHubert Składanowski, machine learning manager at [Datactics](https://www.datactics.com/), has some advice for those looking at the steps needed to get customers prepared.\n\n“Typical checklists include data being complete so it’s free of gaps, being correct with consistent data types, high volume with equally split classes to allow good representation but avoid bias and, crucially, it should represent the use case and the domain,” he says.\n\n“If the production data is often unclear, your training data should not be cleansed by default, unless the same cleansing is applied before the input hits the AI in production,” adds Składanowski.\n\n## How can you support it and build on that process with further services?\n\nThe ideal situation is that once a partner has worked with a customer to prepare the ground for AI, they will then be the one to reap the rewards of providing additional services. There are some suggestions of what those opportunities might look like.\n\n“Once the groundwork is in place, partners can layer additional value by introducing data management and AI-ready services. Observability, cost optimisation and sustainable storage that reduces the environmental footprint of growing data estates are just a few examples of what this could look like,” says NetApp’s Matthieu.\n\n“In fact, this is also where partners can establish long-term relationships. Data environments are not a once-and-done exercise, but something that is continuously evolving. As a result, customers will continually need support monitoring, securing and optimising their AI workloads,” she adds.\n\nThere is also going to be a need for partners to continue getting more of a customer’s infrastructure connected if insights from across the business are to be unlocked.\n\n“Many legacy systems were never designed to detect biased sources, outdated inputs or unclear data origins. This is where partners can add value, by offering services that track these AI-specific risks, helping customers continuously validate their data, so they know it’s still fit for use,” says Zember.\n\n“From there, partners can build additional services around automated data quality checks, strong governance frameworks, model monitoring and bias detection. These layers help maintain reliability as AI scales. By combining strong data foundations with ongoing checks and safeguards, partners can help customers keep risks under control and ensure AI outputs remain accurate, trustworthy and actionable over time,” he adds.\n\nAmy Illingworth, head of channel marketing at [Exclaimer](https://exclaimer.com/), also has some ideas about where the channel can go after the initial data readiness process.\n\n“Once a reseller has helped a customer get data ready, there are a few routes they can take to upsell ongoing support. The natural next step is supporting with ongoing data maintenance – customers rarely have the time or resources to keep data clean, so there is clear recurring revenue potential in monitoring and remediation,” she says.\n\n“Advisory around governance is another growth area, especially as AI regulation evolves. Channel partners are in a strong position to guide small and medium-sized businesses through the complexities if they have limited expertise or understanding. Then there are integration services, such as connecting cleaned, governed data into AI platforms, customer relationship management [CRM], collaboration tools, analytics and line-of-business apps,” adds Illingworth.\n\n“The most advanced partners will optimise efforts for their customers’ verticals to ensure meaningful support, tuning data pipelines and models for particular industry use cases that create real impact. In essence, strong data readiness creates an upsell path into automation, insight services and ongoing AI tuning and optimisation,” she adds.\n\n## What are the prospects for those that develop data readying skills for 2026 and beyond?\n\nThe realisation by more customers around the importance of getting their data into a good position should drive the market forward.\n\n“Data preparation isn’t glamorous, and it may not be a headline – but it is the foundation of every successful AI initiative. Treat your data with the same care you treat your strategy. If the foundation is weak, it’s a failed mission from the get-go. Once you have developed the data readying skills, you will be in a better position to approach AI innovation and apply AI tools, techniques and frameworks to explore solutions,” says N-Able’s Reineke.\n\nExclaimer’s Illingworth stresses that this is not a one-time sale, and relationships between partners and customers should develop over the next year and beyond.\n\n“As the technology moves from the shiny new tool to business as usual, the channel opportunity will follow suit by moving from selling tools to managing the ecosystem, including data quality, ongoing model performance, integration into workflows and compliance. These are all sustainable recurring revenue streams and can foster stickier customer relationships,” she says.\n\n“By developing these skills now, MSPs [managed service providers] and resellers can position themselves as strategic partners rather than commodity suppliers. This is not a one-off project category – it will grow and evolve as organisations scale their AI usage, making data readiness one of the most durable capabilities a partner can invest in,” adds Illingworth.\n\nThe last words go to Dan McAllister, senior vice-president of global alliances and channels at [Boomi](https://boomi.com/), who expects the opportunities for skilled partners to continue into 2026.\n\n“As AI advances, partners that can help organisations to build strong data foundations will be crucial, and will determine which companies get real value from their deployments,” he says. “But more than this, the channel partners that build strong data management offerings now will be ready for whatever innovation falls after agentic AI. This readiness will put them in a prime position to lead the next wave of innovation.”\n\n#### Read more on Managed IT Services\n\n![]()\n\n##### Beyond bandwidth: A strategic blueprint for telco AI\n\n![]()\n\n##### Readying data for AI remains a key channel task\n\n![]()\n\n##### UK channel still working on AI skills\n\n![]()\n\n##### Nvidia, Cisco look to deepen AI innovation across 6G, telecoms\n\n![JoeO’Halloran](https://www.computerweekly.com/rms/computerweekly/Joe-OHalloran-2022-140x180px.jpg)\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/microscopeuk/MIC-1125-ezine-500px.jpg)\n\nClaims that Quantum Computing will destroy Bitcoin may be exaggerated, but Bitcoin will need to adapt.\n\nDespite calls from some data protection campaigners, the UK's agreement to allow data movement with European Economic Area ...\n\nTestbeds accelerate the development and deployment of next-generation digital twin technologies across industries including ...\n\nPresidio has acquired transACT Technology Solutions, a digital transformation specialist based in the United Kingdom, while ...\n\nAccenture, Cognizant and Deloitte are among the partners with offerings on AWS' AI Agents and Tools marketplace, which is ...\n\nCloud marketplaces are emerging as key venues for adoption of AI agents.

This article challenges the traditional linear approach to AI implementation and introduces a cyclical model where AI and data management evolve together. ## Data Readiness & AI: A Mutually Beneficial Cycle. Data readiness remains important to implementing AI, but it is essential to recognize that AI and data management can evolve together in a mutually beneficial cycle. High-quality data enables better AI insights, and those AI insights and systems can, in turn, enhance data management through capabilities like intelligent tagging, anomaly detection, and contextual metadata generation. This symbiotic relationship means organizations should not treat data readiness as a one-off hurdle before AI implementation, but as a continuous process that AI itself can enhance.

Despite the rapid advancements available through AI, many organizations find themselves unable to move forward, believing that their data must be pristine before AI can be utilized effectively. Bifurcated infrastructure, inconsistent metadata, and unclear data ownership slow progress, leading teams to believe they must address their data management fully before pursuing AI at scale.\n\nThis belief can create a significant bottleneck, delaying innovation and hindering technological progress. However, what if the very tools being deferred could help solve the data readiness challenge? AI is no longer just the end goal of a data strategy. AI and data management can evolve together, with AI improving the very data foundations it relies on. From automating data discovery to identifying and enriching metadata quality issues, AI can help improve both upstream and downstream data management.\n\nRather than viewing data readiness as a prerequisite, organizations should see it as a continuous capability that evolves alongside AI. This article challenges the traditional linear approach to AI implementation and introduces a cyclical model where AI and data management evolve together.\n\n## Data Readiness & AI: A Mutually Beneficial Cycle\n\nWhile traditional thinking suggests that data must be perfected before AI can be implemented, the timeline does not have to be inherently linear. Data readiness remains important to implementing AI, but it is essential to recognize that AI and data management can evolve together in a mutually beneficial cycle.\n\nHigh-quality data enables better AI insights, and those AI insights and systems can, in turn, enhance data management through capabilities like intelligent tagging, anomaly detection, and contextual metadata generation. This symbiotic relationship means organizations should not treat data readiness as a one-off hurdle before AI implementation, but as a continuous process that AI itself can enhance.\n\nSome practical ways AI can enhance data management include:\n\n* **Metadata Enrichment & Cataloging:**Generative AI (genAI) and classification models can support metadata tagging, summarization, and contextual enrichment of data sets, making it easier for users to discover and understand their data.\n* **Unlocking Unstructured Data:**Natural language processing and computer vision models can extract meaningful entities and relationships from unstructured data like PDFs, emails, and even handwritten notes, expanding the usable data landscape.\n* **Data Quality Monitoring:**Machine learning models can detect anomalies and errors in real time, helping to catch issues before they can cause any downstream impacts.\n* **Continuous Compliance & Policy Checks:**Natural language processing and anomaly detection models can help monitor data flows for sensitive content and policy violations, while generative models can augment this process by contextualizing alerts to assist in identifying false positives. This hybrid approach reinforces governance practices and surfacing issues that may go unnoticed otherwise.\n\nWhen AI implementation is done effectively, these enhancements to the data processes improve overall data management, which in turn improves the impact of AI-derived insights. For example, in financial trading, AI can flag data quality issues in real-time trading data, leading to improved data processes that make the trading AI itself more effective. It is a two-way street, and companies should seek to improve processes through their implementation.\n\nEmbracing this mutual evolution requires a shift in organizational mindset. Companies need to invest in strong data foundations and be early adopters of AI-driven data tools simultaneously*.*Rather than waiting years to manually perfect a single source of truth, a firm can start deploying AI cataloging or anomaly detection tools now to accelerate its efforts. Letting AI help handle the growing scale and complexity of data allows organizations to work smarter. This must be done with oversight and controls, but organizations that adopt this approach position themselves to innovate faster than those following a linear, chronological pathway.\n\n## What This Means\n\nIn a rush to implement AI, many organizations treat data readiness as a hurdle to clear—a checklist item on the way to implementation. But that framing underestimates the strategic importance of a strong data program and its role in AI. Data readiness is not just the starting line; it is an ongoing enabler.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded across workflows, the relationship becomes cyclical, where better data leads to improved AI insights, and AI, in turn, becomes a lever to enhanced data management. AI is not merely the end consumer of ready data; it is a catalyst for achieving and maintaining that readiness.\n\nThis is where the conversation shifts from linear sequencing to mutual reinforcement. AI thrives on structured, high-quality data and, when used wisely, it helps deliver exactly that. No matter what the domain, investing in your data leads to better results, and AI should aid that investment. The two do not work in silos. Instead, they form a feedback loop that continuously sharpens both sides of the knife. Organizations that embrace this perspective position themselves better not just to deploy AI, but to evolve with it.\n\n## How Forvis Mazars Can Help\n\nInterested in learning how to get AI working for your data management system?

But peel back the layers and you’ll find the same story in most organizations: fragmented datasets, undocumented pipelines, missing context, and noisy warehouses that struggle with even basic reporting.\n\nIt shows up in numbers too.\n\nAnd this is exactly what our Principal Architect, **Ratnesh Parihar**, has been calling out in his deep-dive webinar *“*[*Is Your Data Ready for AI? Common Pitfalls and Practical Solutions.*](https://www.talentica.com/webinars/is-your-data-ready-for-ai-common-pitfalls-and-practical-solutions/)*”*\n\n**“If your data systems and frameworks don’t succeed, AI won’t fail quietly — it will fail loudly.”**\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we’ve seen across enterprise and startup implementations. Teams rush to ship agents, copilots, RAG systems, and LLM-powered workflows—but the data foundation underneath is brittle, incomplete, inconsistent, and ungoverned. And that becomes a death sentence for any LLM or agentic AI implementation.\n\nAfter working through dozens of implementations, Ratnesh broke the core of the problem down into **7 non-negotiable data readiness checks** — all observed firsthand in real pipelines where skipping even one led to broken pipelines, corrupted embeddings, unusable recommendations, compliance issues, or multi-million-dollar rework.\n\n**“When I was constructing my whole experiences with AI and the data pipelines I kind of converted into the seven pointers… this is the seven-pointer checklist whether your system or your data warehouse or your data pipeline is ready for the AI or not.”**\n\nAnd he’s right.\n\nAnd the timing couldn’t be more critical.\n\n## Why these 7 data readiness checks matter now\n\nDeep learning gave us powerful models… but GenAI changed the rules entirely.\n\nAs Ratnesh put it:\n\n**“What we should be prepared as data engineers or data architects is — we need to make sure we follow these trends, we follow these tools, we keep on building these systems, start learning things.”**\n\nThe next wave of AI winners won’t be determined by who fine-tunes better or who uses the latest model. It’ll be determined by:\n\nIf you want AI-native products — copilots, personalized agents, automated workflows, AI-powered search — you need a data architecture that can feed an LLM the **right information, at the right time, with the right context, and in the right format.**\n\nThis is where his 7-point checklist to assess data infrastructure comes in, and why it matters now more than ever.\n\n## 7-point checklist for AI-ready data\n\n### 1️⃣ Unification- Is your data centralized and accessible through single connection?\n\nMost AI projects die at the first step: connecting to data. Research and surveys consistently highlight data access and preparation as the most time-consuming and challenging aspects of an AI/ML project lifecycle.\n\nStartups and enterprises alike store data across:\n\nThis fragmentation kills AI initiatives.\n\n**“The first readiness check is simple: can your team access all critical data through a single unified access point?” — Ratnesh**\n\n#### *Why it matters*\n\nIf your AI app needs inventory, order history, vendor profiles, user behavior, and reviews, but each lives in a different place, your LLM:\n\n#### *Quick test*\n\nIf your backend dev asks, *“Where do I hit for this data?”* and you can’t answer in 10 seconds, you already failed Check #1.\n\n### 2️⃣ Discoverability- Can your team find data without directly accessing it?\n\nThis is one of the most underestimated issues. Industry consensus supports this; the time spent by data professionals searching for and understanding existing data is substantial. This friction severely slows down AI development cycles.\n\nTeams spend hours reverse-engineering naming conventions, schema mismatches, undocumented tables, and old ETL jobs.\n\nAI makes this dramatically worse because:\n\n**“People should be able to discover your data without opening the tables. If they need to inspect raw data to understand structure, you’re not AI-ready.” — Ratnesh**\n\nDiscoverability requires:\n\nWithout this layer, every AI project becomes guesswork.\n\n![](https://www.talentica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unification.webp)\n\n### 3️⃣ Quality & reliability- Whether the quality and reliability checkpoint has been implemented in the place?\n\nThis is where most hallucinations originate—not from the LLM, but from bad data feeding it.\n\nRatnesh says it plainly:\n\n**“If your data is not trustworthy, your model becomes more dangerous, not more intelligent.”**\n\nLLMs are nondeterministic. They amplify whatever you give them—clean or dirty.\n\nYou need:\n\n**“Quality checkpoints must be implicit and by design—not ad-hoc fixes welded into your pipeline.”**\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nData lakes (especially Delta Lakes with DBT) help enforce these constraints automatically—immutability, versioning, lineage, and enforced schema evolution.\n\nIf you’re still using an old warehouse without governance, you’re introducing hallucinations long before the LLM is even called.\n\n### 4️⃣ Real-time access: Can your systems serve live data to LLMs & agents?\n\nYou can’t build modern AI experiences (support copilots, fraud detection, personalization, or decision intelligence) on stale data. AI applications like fraud detection, personalized recommendations, and live customer support agents require the most current context to make accurate and relevant decisions.\n\nRelying on data that is hours or days old (typical of traditional batch ETL processes) severely limits the effectiveness and relevance of these AI systems.\n\nRatnesh’s e-commerce case study makes this brutally clear.\n\nThe client wanted:\n\nBut the system only had batch ETL, outdated data catalogs, and fragmented stores.\n\n**“If your bots or AI agents cannot fetch real-time context, you will always land in the hallucination zone.” — Ratnesh**\n\n### **Ask yourself**\n\nCan your LLM retrieve:\n\nIf the answer is no, your AI feature will behave like a clueless intern who’s always one day behind.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\n### 5️⃣ Trustworthiness- Is your data credible and complete enough to generate reliable AI outputs?\n\nTrustworthiness goes beyond “quality.”\n\nIt asks:\n\n**“If your data gives mixed signals, the LLM will hallucinate. It’s not the model. It’s your inconsistency.” — Ratnesh**\n\nAn LLM cannot discern which of two conflicting data sources is correct; it will simply blend or choose one, often producing a “mixed signal” output.\n\nIn the e-commerce case:\n\nOne missing trust layer, and the AI support assistant started giving wrong advice.\n\nAI is a multiplier. If your raw material is flawed, AI magnifies the flaw.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\n### 6️⃣ Scalability & cost awareness- Are you prepared for LLM-heavy workloads?\n\nMany teams underestimate the cost side of AI.  Initial proof-of-concepts often use readily available cloud resources, but scaling these to production-level usage reveals significant recurring costs associated with computation (GPU usage for inference/training), vector search, and data processing.\n\nRAG pipelines, embeddings, vector search, streaming updates—all come with recurring costs.\n\n**“If you’re building on top of premium LLMs, you’re offering a premium product. The question is: will users pay for it?”**\n\nIf the answer is no, you must rethink:\n\nBecause using expensive, high-end commercial LLMs (like OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Anthropic’s Claude 3 Opus) incurs per-token costs that can quickly become economically unviable for standard enterprise applications where the user value doesn’t justify the operational expense.\n\nRatnesh is blunt about this:\n\n**“If you want a normal enterprise application, but you use premium AI patterns, you’ll burn cash unnecessarily.”**\n\nScalability isn’t just about infra. It’s about economic sustainability.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\n### 7️⃣ Contextualization- Does your data encode the rich context AI needs?\n\nThis is the *silent killer* of most AI deployments.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nMost companies have no consistent structure for:\n\nData for a “product” might exist in an inventory system, a sales log, and a support database, but without a shared, consistent structure, the AI cannot link these pieces together into a single, rich understanding.\n\nIn the e-commerce example, wrong or missing context caused:\n\nLLMs rely heavily on the context provided in their input window to generate meaningful responses. Without context, an LLM might misinterpret a sales spike as fraud or a positive trend, leading to poor decisions. It cannot discern the nuance or intent behind the raw data.\n\nRatnesh puts it clearly:\n\n**“If your system isn’t built to preserve context, everything looks like a vague text blob to an LLM.”**\n\nLet’s take another case study\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nLLMs need context-rich data to chunk, embed, rank, and answer accurately.\n\nWithout it, your AI behaves randomly—sometimes correct, often confidently wrong.\n\nContextualization is a non-negotiable requirement for moving AI from experimental pilots to reliable, production-grade applications.\n\n## How modern data lakes solve many of these problems automatically\n\nModern Delta Lakes (combined with DBT and strong governance) embed best practices into the system:\n\n### **✔️ Immutability**\n\nPrevents accidental overwrites and duplication.\n\n### **✔️ Automatic schema enforcement**\n\nPrevents broken pipelines.\n\n### **✔️ Versioned data**\n\nEnables rollback and auditability.\n\n### **✔️ Built-in quality rules**\n\nEliminates manual fixes.\n\n### **✔️ Cataloging + lineage**\n\nDrives discoverability.\n\n### **✔️ Uniform layers (raw → curated → semantic)**\n\nProvides a clean path for embedding generation.\n\n**“The quality of embeddings, the accuracy of chunking, and the consistency of semantics — all depend on how clean your lakehouse foundation is.”**\n\nThis is why Ratnesh recommends embedding generation *on curated semantic layers*, not raw stores or old warehouses.\n\n### Why most companies skip these 7 checks\n\nBecause they assume AI sits “on top” of the product.\n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nLLMs, agents, copilots, and RAG pipelines rely heavily on:\n\nAI is not a feature — **it’s an architectural shift.**\n\n**“To build systems that are first-time-right, the foundation must be first-right by design.” — Ratnesh**\n\n## Your AI can only be as good as your data\n\nIf you skip these seven readiness checks, you’re not just slowing down innovation — you’re sabotaging your AI stack.\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable reality:\n\nCompanies that succeed with AI don’t start with the model. They start with the **data foundation**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBefore you build your next AI feature, ask: Is my data truly AI-ready? Or am I hoping the model will compensate for the gaps?\n\nAs Ratnesh aptly puts it:\n\n*“AI will not fix bad data. It amplifies it. If you get your seven checks right, most of your AI challenges disappear before they even show up.”*\n\nA reliable AI foundation requires reliable data engineering. We provide the foundational engineering expertise to build a clean, curated data layer.

The impact data and AI leaders can have in the hedge fund industry is significant. In the absence of governance, data is scattered across architectures, and teams lack a centralized way to understand how signals derived from raw data connect, how features are constructed, and how business context influences AI driven predictions. For hedge funds, data governance enables the design of self service environments that map features, bundles, and models using product management principles. A strong governance program delivers a fully governed data and AI architecture that supports data engineers, ML and AI engineers, quant researchers, trading operators, and portfolio managers. Your hedge fund example brilliantly illustrates the critical role of data governance in AI.

Its benefits are broad and apply to technology, information science, medical science, security, and consumer privacy. The impact of AI is already visible across industries. In automotive through self driving vehicles. In retail where AI drives supply chain automation and customer sentiment analysis to improve experience. In medical science through diagnostics and early disease detection such as cancer. These examples only scratch the surface.\n\nWhile AI presents unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation to address human needs, it also raises fundamental questions around morals, ethics, and ethos. Much of today’s organizational focus is on delivering AI powered products to meet consumer demand. However, there is a growing need to address AI explainability to govern how AI is built, operated, and deployed. This is critical to building consumer trust. AI safety and literacy also require greater attention, as not all workers and everyday users fully understand AI’s capabilities, limitations, or risks.\n\nThe conversation should not only be about what AI can do, but how AI should be developed, governed, and used to serve the basic needs of consumers responsibly.\n\nThe promise of AI is here, but unlocking its full value requires companies to get their data in order. AI depends on strong data foundations. Data leaders today face the challenge of balancing data infrastructure, architecture, workforce literacy, and governance. As data volumes are expected to double or triple every 12 to 18 months, much of this data remains untapped. Research shows that nearly two thirds of data stored in cloud environments is underutilized, limiting the true potential of AI.\n\nTo truly innovate with AI, many factors exist both within and outside the control of data and technology leaders. Data architectures often become siloed when they are not designed with a clear end goal. Conversations with leaders across industries reveal a common pattern. Organizations struggle with data accessibility and usability, leaving users unable to fully benefit from the data available to them. The last edition of Data Stash by Kash, \"[Data Actors: Zombies in the Enterprise](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-actors-zombies-enterprise-kash-mehdi-ij4ee/?trackingId=qjOIEVlfR56mzCsmPe4g%2FQ%3D%3D&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)\" unpacks a list of challenges faced by different data actors and remains a core barrier to realizing AI driven value.\n\n## Examples from the Hedge Fund Industry\n\nTake quantitative finance as an example, where trusted data is a critical factor in AI development for hedge funds. Data is a core operational asset. Every data point can move millions, and given the highly regulated nature of the industry, every AI driven decision must be reproducible and explainable.\n\nMany hedge funds today focus on building the best prediction engines to deliver strong investment strategies for shareholders. These strategies are shaped by internal research and development platforms where AI sits at the center of decision making and strategy construction. To provide context, a common practice across hedge funds is the large scale acquisition of financial data from providers such as Bloomberg, Aladdin, S&P Capital, and others. This data often arrives in a raw, fragmented, and inconsistent state.\n\nWithout strong data governance, organizations quickly develop silos. Data teams become disconnected, definitions vary, and data quality suffers. Even with modern data lakes or warehouses in place, the underlying data often remains messy and difficult to use. As a result, many hedge funds are recognizing the need for a more distributed operating model. This approach empowers data teams closest to the data and its signals, while assigning clear ownership to ensure consistency, trust, and accountability.\n\n### Focus Area for Data & AI Leaders in Hedge Fund\n\nThe impact data and AI leaders can have in the hedge fund industry is significant. Feature engineering functions, in particular, operate within highly complex data ecosystems where understanding data relationships is essential. In the absence of governance, data is scattered across architectures, and teams lack a centralized way to understand how signals derived from raw data connect, how features are constructed, and how business context influences AI driven predictions.\n\n### At the core of feature engineering, three key elements exist\n\n1. Features are specific data points or transformations derived from raw data. They are curated and combined to feed predictive models and improve accuracy and relevance.\n2. Bundles are collections of related features that support specific analytical use cases. They group financial and economic signals that serve as inputs for model training and research workflows.\n3. Models consume these features to predict market behavior, optimize portfolios, and identify investment opportunities. Each model is tailored to a defined set of prediction or analysis tasks.\n\n### Data Actors and their needs\n\nIn this context, a quant researcher must understand which features are consumed by which models and what data feeds each feature. This becomes increasingly difficult when data relationships are unclear and researchers face millions of potential data points without knowing which ones can be trusted.\n\nAligning data and AI decisions with business value is critical. These decisions directly impact core objectives such as managing systematic investment strategies, building high performance research and development platforms, and improving AI performance through better collaboration between researchers and engineers.\n\nFor hedge funds, data governance enables the design of self service environments that map features, bundles, and models using product management principles. Data and AI products are intentionally designed to solve specific business problems for defined users, with clear processes for discovery, usage, and accountability.\n\nA strong governance program delivers a fully governed data and AI architecture that supports data engineers, ML and AI engineers, quant researchers, trading operators, and portfolio managers.\n\n### Lessons Learned\n\nSeveral lessons emerge that can be applied across industries beyond hedge funds.\n\n1. Governance cannot be an afterthought. It must be embedded directly into data and feature production.\n2. Feature ownership and quality standards should be clearly defined through metadata, validation rules, update frequency, and statistical thresholds.\n3. Finally, feedback loops are essential. Automated monitoring of features and models allows teams to measure performance impact and continuously improve outcomes.\n\n---\n\n[Data Stash by Kash](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/data-stash-by-kash-7014641723704233984) \n\n### Data Stash by Kash\n\n#### 4,051 followers\n\n[+ Subscribe](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_like-toggle_like-cta)\n\nLike\n\nCelebrate\n\nSupport\n\nLove\n\nInsightful\n\nFunny\n\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_comment-cta)\n\n[33](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_likes-count_social-actions-reactions)   [3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_likes-count_social-actions-comments)\n\n[Murat Kose](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/murat-kose-064667288?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment_actor-name)   3d \n\n* [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=COMMENT&_f=guest-reporting)\n\nYour hedge fund example brilliantly illustrates the critical role of data governance in AI. The features-bundles-models framework you outlined is particularly insightful - it shows how complex data ecosystems need clear ownership and lineage tracking. The point about 2/3 of cloud data being underutilized resonates strongly. Without proper governance and metadata management, even the best AI models will struggle. The lesson about embedding governance into feature production (not as an afterthought) is crucial for any data-intensive organization.

AI outcomes are only as strong as the data foundations beneath them. Beyond infrastructure, what I see making the biggest difference is clear data ownership, governance, and shared understanding across teams without that, scale and trust remain hard to achieve, no matter how advanced the models are.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment_like) [Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments-action_comment_reply)  1 Reaction\n\n[See more comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_comments_comment-see-more)\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=%2Fpulse%2Fdata-readiness-ai-explained-kash-mehdi-rwzie&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_x-social-details_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n## More articles by Kash Mehdi\n\n* [First 100 Days CDO Roadmap for 2026](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-100-days-cdo-roadmap-2026-kash-mehdi-nghoe) \n\n  Dec 18, 2025\n\n  ### First 100 Days CDO Roadmap for 2026\n\n  To drive value through governance, a Chief Data Officer (CDO) must execute a precise, action-oriented plan in their…\n\n  21\n\n  1 Comment\n* [Data Actors: Zombies in the Enterprise](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-actors-zombies-enterprise-kash-mehdi-ij4ee) \n\n  Nov 30, 2025\n\n  ### Data Actors: Zombies in the Enterprise\n\n  Introduction Most of us know the saying that culture overrides strategy.

Yet, while the floodgates of innovation and opportunity have opened, [chief information officers (CIOs)](/en_us/cio) and their C-suite colleagues may find that their companies are ill-equipped to capitalize on AI because of long-standing limitations with their data programs and infrastructure.\n\nHow EY can help\n\n* [Artificial Intelligence Consulting Services](/en_us/services/consulting/artificial-intelligence-consulting-services)\n\n  Our Consulting approach to the adoption of AI and intelligent automation is human-centered, pragmatic, outcomes-focused and ethical.\n\n   [Read more](/en_us/services/consulting/artificial-intelligence-consulting-services)\n\nAn [EY online survey](/en_us/consulting/businesses-can-stop-rising-ai-use-from-fueling-anxiety) revealed that 90% of respondents who work a desk/office job and are at least somewhat familiar with AI say that their organization uses at least one AI technology, with GenAI topping the list. Most say that using AI at work will make them more efficient (82%) and more productive (81%), and will let them focus on higher-value work (81%).\n\n \n\nGenAI, in particular, has taken off in areas such as marketing, content management, contract management and the call center. This is on top of applied AI applications that are used to generate predictive insights that lead to more intelligent decision-making.\n\n \n\nThe survey found that, despite the mounting enthusiasm for these and myriad other use cases, there is anxiety about AI, including legal risks (69%), ethical and moral considerations (67%) and cybersecurity risks (67%). The data being used to fuel AI models is also under scrutiny. Almost half (48%) of respondents to the 2023 Foundry AI Priorities Study said that data quality and quantity issues could impede genAI implementations. They’re also concerned about data privacy and ethical considerations (41%), data variability (37%), and unlabeled or weakly labeled data (29%).\n\n \n\nAs [organizations prepare to leverage AI](/en_us/services/consulting/artificial-intelligence-consulting-services) for competitive advantage, many lack a robust foundation that primes their data for effective AI use at scale. These foundational components include data management and governance practices, AI governance and mature platforms for operationalizing the technology.\n\n \n\n“AI needs management and governance to ensure ethical, security, economic and legal concerns are addressed, and associated risks are mitigated,” says [Zakir Hussain](/en_us/people/profile-blueprint.people.html/content/dam/content-fragments/ey-unified-site/ey-com/people/global/en/zakir-hussain), EY Americas Data Leader. “All of those need to be understood, planned for, and managed, and many companies are just not ready.”\n\n \n\n## Getting your data ready for AI\n\nWhere do most companies fall short in pursuit of [**AI-ready data**](/en_us/services/emerging-technologies/knowledge-assets-enable-ai-to-make-informed-decisions)? Maturity levels vary, but most enterprises are lacking in one or more areas of data management, leading to an abundance of proof-of-concept (POC) project failures, Hussain says.\n\n \n\nData that is truly optimized for AI has four key characteristics, he explains:\n\n* The data is reliable.\n* It’s **[accessible and scalable](/en_us/insights/emerging-technologies/learn-how-leaders-deployed-generative-ai-for-employees)**.\n* It’s visible with the proper context and consistency.\n* It’s trusted and secure.\n\nTo get there, organizations need the following technology and process pillars in place:\n\n* An AI-ready data strategy that is focused on [**business value drivers**](/en_us/services/emerging-technologies/six-pillars-of-ai-success-for-the-c-suite)\n* Data governance for data consumers to explore, discover and use data sources efficiently\n* Master data management for a single source of truth\n* A risk and compliance framework for properly managed risks and access controls\n* Data quality and data wrangling capabilities to ensure solutions with curated and validated data\n* A robust data architecture for rapidly piloting and scaling solutions\n\n“All of these elements determine whether data is ready for AI or not,” Hussain says. “If data isn’t contextualized, tagged or mastered properly, or if data lineage is broken, it’s bound to generate wrong predictions and drive the wrong decisions.”\n\n \n\nBeyond investment in the right technology and data architecture, CIOs can foster data centricity and more mature practices by shifting data and analytics projects and culture toward a product management mindset. The traditional approach of data councils and enterprise data governance has moved the needle on establishing common taxonomies, developing shared data policies and curating multiple data sources. Yet, those practices often don’t go far enough to change culture or solve systematic data problems. Revamping organizational structure to establish product owners, creating practices for managing data throughout its entire lifecycle, and building teams that are focused on outcomes and results will go a long way in creating AI-ready data while increasing demand and funding for data and analytics initiatives.\n\n \n\n## 4 steps to better data management\n\nWe offer a number of other recommendations that are designed to promote AI-ready data and data management practices:\n\n**Develop a proper roadmap:** No data or AI initiative will succeed on its own without a formal business case and an intentional set of business outcomes. CIOs and data leaders need to thoroughly examine the value drivers for their individual organizations and formulate a data and AI roadmap that is aligned to those specific business goals and in cooperation with their business partners.\n\n**Place relentless focus on value:**Too many AI and data-driven pilot projects fail because they’re too narrow or not tied to a specific business outcome. As opposed to doing a POC with a small data set just to establish relevancy and demonstrate success, Hussain advises CIOs to conduct pilot projects with real data that addresses a high-priority business problem or opportunity. “Stay focused on results and build a pipeline of use cases that are very results-oriented,” he says. “That will pave the way for the company to mature their data readiness.”\n\n**Leverage AI (including GenAI) for efficiencies:**GenAI can play a role in [**streamlining data management and data quality practices.**](/en_us/services/emerging-technologies/choosing-genai-for-business-efficiency-over-complexity) For example, it can help to automate data quality checks, bring greater intelligence to master data management and help ensure dynamic data governance policies. “Things are changing so fast – you can’t set a governance policy and let it sit there for the next few years,” Hussain says. “Using GenAI to set up dynamic data policies allows systems and organizations to adapt and evolve policies.”\n\n**Move quickly, but prepare for a marathon:**As AI looms large, business leaders are hankering to move fast. However, being too aggressive can result in data management missteps that slow down progress. It’s critical to develop a holistic strategy to modernize and ensure AI-ready data. “This is not a sprint,” Hussain says. “Data modernization needs to be carefully thought out, and you have to build a holistic strategy focused on business value drivers, and that’s not just about technology.”\n\nErnst & Young LLP (EY US) commissioned a third-party vendor to conduct the AI Anxiety in Business Survey. The online survey was performed among 1,000 Americans who work an office/desk job, either full- or part-time, and are at least somewhat familiar with AI. The survey was conducted from October 5-16, 2023. The margin of error for the total sample is +/- 3 percentage points.  \n *The views expressed by the author are not necessarily those of Ernst & Young LLP or other members of the global EY organization.*  \n   \n Foundry, “Foundry’s Inaugural AI Priorities Study Examines Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Organizations”, October 10, 2023.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe rise of generative AI, or GenAI, has shown organizations the potential of AI technologies. Yet, many companies cannot fully leverage AI due to limitations in their data programs. An EY survey reveals that while 90% of respondents use AI, 48% worry that data quality and quantity issues could hinder GenAI's effective implementation.\n\nThis article was originally published on CIO.com\n\nAbout this article\n\nRelated topics \n\n[Technology leader's agenda](/en_us/cio)\n\n[AI](/en_us/services/ai)\n\n[Consulting](/en_us/services/ai)\n\n[Emerging technology](/en_us/services/ai)\n\n* [Facebook](# \"Facebook\")\n* [Twitter](# \"Twitter\")\n* [LinkedIn](# \"LinkedIn\")\n* Link Copied\n\nRelated articles\n\n[Why agentic AI is a revolution stuck in an evolution](/en_us/insights/emerging-technologies/pulse-ai-survey)\n\nThis AI survey shows how AI investments are turning into business productivity gains and significant financial performance.\n\n[How AI ready data can help drive AI strategy success](/en_us/services/emerging-technologies/knowledge-assets-enable-ai-to-make-informed-decisions)\n\nOrganizations’ AI strategies should include the creation of AI ready data, which can help them lower training costs and boost response accuracy.

            "## Custom AI Workforce\n\nFor small-business leaders navigating today's competitive landscape, the concept of a custom AI workforce is emerging as a powerful solution to perennial challenges like staff shortages and rising customer expectations [1]. This innovative approach brings enterprise-grade automation within reach of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), allowing them to deploy specialized AI agents tailored to their unique operational needs [1, 2].\n\nUnlike generic AI tools, a custom AI employee is an intelligent agent built and trained on a business's specific workflows, rules, internal documents, and customer data [1, 3]. This deep integration enables the AI to perform real work that aligns precisely with a company's established processes, rather than just offering general assistance [3]. Businesses define the role, train the AI using their existing knowledge and procedures, and then deploy it where needed, often with no-code setup required [1, 3].\n\nThe benefits for SMBs are significant, including standardizing key workflows, enhancing customer touchpoints, and unlocking new levels of productivity without needing to expand headcount [1, 2]. These custom AI agents can connect to existing business systems via APIs, allowing them to take practical actions beyond simple chat. This means they can check inventory, create CRM records, schedule appointments, or manage billing follow-ups, operating consistently across various channels such as website chat, internal team communication, and automated workflows [3].\n\nReal-world applications highlight the transformative potential. For instance, at Blue River Digital, a custom AI employee named \"Banks\" revolutionized their sales process by generating six proposals in minutes instead of hours, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This allowed the team to scale operations more efficiently without adding staff [1, 3]. Similarly, The Xcite Group leveraged their custom AI, \"Klaygent,\" to train on years of internal advertising data, enabling every team member to provide instant, expert-level recommendations, improving sales effectiveness and customer experience [1, 3]. Beyond these, custom AI can handle a wide array of high-volume tasks like quoting, project updates, internal knowledge support, and customer communications [3].\n\nThis tailored integration of AI stands in contrast to the historical trend where the biggest gains from generative AI often favored larger organizations with deep integration capabilities [1]. By focusing on practical, workflow-ready AI, SMBs can now equip their human teams to be more productive. As the AI landscape evolves, the focus shifts from replacing workers to augmenting them, empowering a \"centaur\" workforce (human + AI) that drives greater value [5]. The future envisions an expansion of these AI workforces, with more pre-configured options for common roles like reputation management and sales operations, alongside the ongoing flexibility for businesses to build fully custom AI solutions [1, 2]. This marks the dawn of a truly AI-powered local economy, addressing chronic staff shortages with intelligent, scalable solutions [1].\n\n---\nSources:\n[1] Vendasta Unveils Custom AI Employees to Redefine the Future of... — vendasta.com\n[2] Vendasta Unveils Custom AI Employees to Redefine the Future of... — finance.yahoo.com\n[3] Custom AI Employees - Vendasta — vendasta.com\n[4] Custom AI Solutions - Turbine Workforce — turbineworkforce.com\n[5] AI Revolution 2025: Building the Future Workforce Today — baytechconsulting.com",
            "## AI Tool Accuracy & Use\n\nAs AI tools become increasingly integrated into daily operations, small-business leaders must approach their implementation with a clear understanding of their inherent limitations, particularly regarding accuracy. Even the most advanced AI models are not infallible; for instance, the top-performing Gemini 3 Pro model achieves only 68.8% overall factual accuracy, meaning it gets facts wrong roughly one-third of the time [1]. This underscores the critical need for human oversight and verification of AI-generated content.\n\nThe reliability challenges extend to tools designed to detect AI-generated content. A multitude of AI detectors exist, claiming to identify text and images produced by large language models like GPT [2]. However, multiple studies indicate these detectors are \"neither accurate nor reliable,\" frequently generating high rates of both false positives and false negatives [5, 2]. False positives incorrectly flag human-written content as AI-generated, which can lead to significant issues, particularly given that these tools are prone to flagging non-native English speakers or neurodivergent writers at higher rates due to their writing styles [5]. Conversely, false negatives occur when AI-generated text goes undetected. Users can often circumvent these detectors through simple evasive techniques, such as paraphrasing, adding emotional elements, or using specialized \"humanizer\" AI tools [5].

            "## Data Readiness for AI\n\nThe allure of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for boosting efficiency, gaining insights, and transforming operations is undeniable for small-business leaders. However, effectively harnessing AI's power hinges on a foundational, often overlooked, element: data readiness [1, 5]. Many organizations are enthusiastic, with 94% increasing spending on AI data readiness, yet only 21% have successfully integrated AI into their operations [1]. Without a robust data strategy, AI initiatives risk failure, with Gartner estimating that 60% of AI projects built on unready data will be abandoned by 2026 [3].\n\nThe core principle is simple: \"garbage in, garbage out\" [1]. If the data used to train AI models is biased, incomplete, outdated, or inconsistent, the AI's outputs will reflect these flaws. This is especially true for unstructured data—emails, documents, images, and videos—which constitutes 80-90% of enterprise data and is crucial for advanced AI innovation [1]. Dispersed across silos, difficult to access, and often lacking proper management, this vast dataset holds immense potential if properly prepared [1].\n\nAchieving AI-ready data requires a strategic approach focusing on several key pillars:\n\n1.  **Quality and Trustworthiness:** Data must be complete, correct, consistent, and free of bias to generate reliable AI outputs [1, 3, 5]. Quality checkpoints need to be embedded by design, not as afterthoughts, to prevent AI from amplifying flaws and leading to \"hallucinations\" or incorrect decisions [3]. For instance, in finance, trusted data is critical because every AI-driven decision must be reproducible and explainable [4].\n\n2.  **Unification and Accessibility:** AI applications demand access to all critical data through a single, unified point [3]. Data fragmented across various systems (databases, cloud storage, spreadsheets) makes it challenging for AI models to connect disparate pieces of information, hindering comprehensive insights [3]. This also includes ensuring data is stored in the right place for the right workload, whether on-premise, in the cloud, or at the edge [1].\n\n3.  **Governance and Discoverability:** Strong data governance is paramount for managing data throughout its lifecycle, ensuring visibility, security, and compliance [1, 4, 5]. This means clear ownership, consistent metadata, documented data lineage, and a framework for risk and access controls [3, 4, 5]. Data should be discoverable without needing direct access to tables, requiring robust cataloging and standardized definitions to speed up AI development [3].\n\n4.  **Real-time Access and Contextualization:** Modern AI applications, such as personalized recommendations or fraud detection, require real-time data to make accurate decisions [3]. Stale data significantly limits effectiveness [3]. Moreover, data needs rich context to be meaningful to AI, including relationships, intent, and relevance [3]. Without proper contextualization, AI struggles to link information, leading to vague or inaccurate responses [3].\n\n5.  **Scalability and Cost Awareness:** AI workloads can be resource-intensive, incurring significant recurring costs for computation and data processing [3]. An AI-ready data infrastructure must consider the economic sustainability of scaling AI solutions, optimizing for efficiency without compromising performance [3].\n\nInterestingly, AI isn't just a consumer of ready data; it can actively enhance data management in a mutually beneficial cycle [2]. AI capabilities can automate data discovery, enrich metadata, detect anomalies in real-time, and monitor for policy violations, improving overall data quality and governance [2]. This symbiotic relationship suggests that data readiness is not a one-off hurdle, but a continuous process that AI itself can accelerate [2].\n\nUltimately, data readiness is an ongoing journey and an architectural shift, not a single project [1, 3]. Organizations that commit to building and maintaining strong data foundations will be better positioned to unlock AI's full value, foster long-term relationships with customers through enhanced services, and lead the next wave of innovation [1].\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n[1] How to sell: Data readiness for AI — Computerweekly (computerweekly.com)\n[2] Data Management & AI: The Two-Way Street of Data Readiness — Forvis Mazars (forvismazars.us)\n[3] 7 Data Readiness Checks You're Probably Skipping — But Your AI... — Talentica (talentica.com)\n[4] Data Readiness for AI Explained — LinkedIn (linkedin.com)\n[5] The big leap: Getting data AI-ready — EY - US (ey.com)"

We delve into the transformative power of custom AI workforces, explore the crucial need for human oversight and accuracy with AI tools, and highlight the foundational importance of data readiness to unlock AI's full potential.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #0056b3; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">Custom AI Workforce</h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        For small-business leaders navigating today's competitive landscape, the concept of a custom AI workforce is emerging as a powerful solution to perennial challenges like staff shortages and rising customer expectations <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a></sup>. This innovative approach brings enterprise-grade automation within reach of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), allowing them to deploy specialized AI agents tailored to their unique operational needs <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-2\">2</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        Unlike generic AI tools, a custom AI employee is an intelligent agent built and trained on a business's specific workflows, rules, internal documents, and customer data <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>. This deep integration enables the AI to perform real work that aligns precisely with a company's established processes, rather than just offering general assistance <sup><a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>. Businesses define the role, train the AI using their existing knowledge and procedures, and then deploy it where needed, often with no-code setup required <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        The benefits for SMBs are significant, including standardizing key workflows, enhancing customer touchpoints, and unlocking new levels of productivity without needing to expand headcount <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-2\">2</a></sup>. These custom AI agents can connect to existing business systems via APIs, allowing them to take practical actions beyond simple chat. This means they can check inventory, create CRM records, schedule appointments, or manage billing follow-ups, operating consistently across various channels such as website chat, internal team communication, and automated workflows <sup><a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        Real-world applications highlight the transformative potential. For instance, at Blue River Digital, a custom AI employee named \"Banks\" revolutionized their sales process by generating six proposals in minutes instead of hours, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This allowed the team to scale operations more efficiently without adding staff <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>. Similarly, The Xcite Group leveraged their custom AI, \"Klaygent,\" to train on years of internal advertising data, enabling every team member to provide instant, expert-level recommendations, improving sales effectiveness and customer experience <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>. Beyond these, custom AI can handle a wide array of high-volume tasks like quoting, project updates, internal knowledge support, and customer communications <sup><a href=\"#source-3\">3</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        This tailored integration of AI stands in contrast to the historical trend where the biggest gains from generative AI often favored larger organizations with deep integration capabilities <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a></sup>. By focusing on practical, workflow-ready AI, SMBs can now equip their human teams to be more productive. As the AI landscape evolves, the focus shifts from replacing workers to augmenting them, empowering a \"centaur\" workforce (human + AI) that drives greater value <sup><a href=\"#source-5\">5</a></sup>. The future envisions an expansion of these AI workforces, with more pre-configured options for common roles like reputation management and sales operations, alongside the ongoing flexibility for businesses to build fully custom AI solutions <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#source-2\">2</a></sup>. This marks the dawn of a truly AI-powered local economy, addressing chronic staff shortages with intelligent, scalable solutions <sup><a href=\"#source-1\">1</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2 style=\"color: #0056b3; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;\">AI Tool Accuracy & Use</h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        As AI tools become increasingly integrated into daily operations, small-business leaders must approach their implementation with a clear understanding of their inherent limitations, particularly regarding accuracy. Even the most advanced AI models are not infallible; for instance, the top-performing Gemini 3 Pro model achieves only 68.8% overall factual accuracy, meaning it gets facts wrong roughly one-third of the time <sup><a href=\"#source-6\">1</a></sup>. This underscores the critical need for human oversight and verification of AI-generated content.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        The reliability challenges extend to tools designed to detect AI-generated content. A multitude of AI detectors exist, claiming to identify text and images produced by large language models like GPT <sup><a href=\"#source-7\">2</a></sup>. However, multiple studies indicate these detectors are \"neither accurate nor reliable,\" frequently generating high rates of both false positives and false negatives <sup><a href=\"#source-10\">5</a>, <a href=\"#source-7\">2</a></sup>. False positives incorrectly flag human-written content as AI-generated, which can lead to significant issues, particularly given that these tools are prone to flagging non-native English speakers or neurodivergent writers at higher rates due to their writing styles <sup><a href=\"#source-10\">5</a></sup>. Conversely, false negatives occur when AI-generated text goes undetected. Users can often circumvent these detectors through simple evasive techniques, such as paraphrasing, adding emotional elements, or using specialized \"humanizer\" AI tools <sup><a href=\"#source-10\">5</a></sup>. This creates an \"eternal arms race\" where generators and detectors constantly evolve, with no definitive solution in sight <sup><a href=\"#source-10\">5</a></sup>.\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n        Given these detection challenges and the inherent inaccuracies of generative AI, the imperative for human vetting is paramount.
